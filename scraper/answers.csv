Diagnostics are provided to assist with return preparation and checking prior to transmitting an electronic return.
New for TY16 - Convenient access to Forms status under the Diagnostics tab.  Click here to access Forms Status Notification Tool.

There are three categories of return diagnostics: Fatal, Critical and Informational

Critical Diagnostics are generated when input is missing or present that will cause a return to be rejected or filed incorrectly. 
Critical diagnostics that have to do with an electronically filed return will have ""e-file"" in front of them.  These diagnostics will prevent a return from being electronically filed until they are either cleared or bypassed.

Caution: Critical diagnostics should not be bypassed using the Disable e-file Error Checking function unless instructed to do so.

Critical diagnostics are also generated for issues that will impact the paper filing of a return and when a form is in draft state or instructions are not final. 
Whenever additional information is available, it is included in a link to a KB article, indicated by a ""More Info"" icon next to the diagnostic.
Checkboxes are located next to the diagnostic messages. When the diagnostic has been reviewed, you have the option of checking the box, which will strikethrough the diagnostic.  Checking the box does not resolve a diagnostic, it merely indicates the diagnostic has been reviewed.

Solution Description
You would only use (16) State wages, if different if the amount of wages for the resident state is more or less than the federal amount. Example: The home state does not recognize pretax deductions to taxable wages, so the state taxable wages will be greater than the federal wages that do recognize pretax deductions. An entry in this field will typically cause an adjustment on the State return.

Diagnostics are provided to assist with return preparation and checking prior to transmitting an electronic return.
New for TY16 - Convenient access to Forms status under the Diagnostics tab.  Click here to access Forms Status Notification Tool.

There are three categories of return diagnostics: Fatal, Critical and Informational

Critical Diagnostics are generated when input is missing or present that will cause a return to be rejected or filed incorrectly. 
Critical diagnostics that have to do with an electronically filed return will have ""e-file"" in front of them.  These diagnostics will prevent a return from being electronically filed until they are either cleared or bypassed.

Caution: Critical diagnostics should not be bypassed using the Disable e-file Error Checking function unless instructed to do so.

Critical diagnostics are also generated for issues that will impact the paper filing of a return and when a form is in draft state or instructions are not final. 
Whenever additional information is available, it is included in a link to a KB article, indicated by a ""More Info"" icon next to the diagnostic.
Checkboxes are located next to the diagnostic messages. When the diagnostic has been reviewed, you have the option of checking the box, which will strikethrough the diagnostic.  Checking the box does not resolve a diagnostic, it merely indicates the diagnostic has been reviewed.

 IRS Warns of a New Wave of Attacks Focused on Tax Professionals WASHINGTON - The Internal Revenue Service today warned tax professionals of a new wave of attacks that allow identity thieves to file fraudulent tax returns by remotely taking over practitioners? computers. As part of the Security Summit effort, the IRS urged tax professionals to review their tax preparation software settings and immediately enact all security measures, especially those settings that require usernames and passwords to access the products.  The IRS is aware of approximately two dozen cases where tax professionals have been victimized in recent days. The IRS, state tax agencies and the tax industry - working as partners in the Security Summit - recently launched the Protect Your Clients; Protect Yourself campaign to increase awareness that criminals increasingly are targeting tax professionals and the taxpayer data they possess.  ""This latest incident reinforces the need for all tax professionals to review their computer settings as soon as possible,"" said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. ""Identity thieves continue to evolve and look for new areas to exploit?, especially as our fraud filters become more effective. The prompt identification of these attacks is another example of the great benefits that result from the close working relationship the IRS now has with the tax industry and the states through the Security Summit initiative. Information is flowing more rapidly between our groups as we continue? our efforts to protect taxpayers."" These attacks come as the Oct. 17 deadline approaches for extension filers. The IRS first warned of a similar remote take-over attack in the spring, just ahead of the April 15 deadline, another peak period for tax professionals. Thieves are able to access tax professionals' computers and use remote technology to take control, accessing client data and completing and e-filing tax returns but directing refunds to criminals' own accounts. Victims in the tax community learned of these thefts while reconciling e-file acknowledgements. In addition to activating security measures for tax software products, IRS urges all tax preparers to take the following steps:

Run a security ""deep scan"" to search for viruses and malware;
Strengthen passwords for both computer access and software access; make sure your password is a minimum of eight digits (more is better) with a mix of numbers, letters and special characters and change them often;
Be alert for phishing scams: do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders;
Educate all staff members about the dangers of phishing scams in the form of emails, texts and calls;
Review any software that your employees use to remotely access your network and/or your IT support vendor uses to remotely troubleshoot technical problems and support your systems. Remote access software is a potential target for bad actors to gain entry and take control of a machine.
 In addition, the IRS recently issued instructions to tax professionals on how to monitor their PTIN activity. Tax professionals should review Publication 4557, Safeguarding Taxpayer Data, a Guide for Your Business, which provides a checklist to help safeguard taxpayer information and enhance office security. Also, practitioners should review Data Breach Information for Tax Professionals for information on what action they should take if they do become victims.

 Security Summit Alert: New Two-Stage E-mail Scheme Targets Tax Professionals WASHINGTON ? The Internal Revenue Service, state tax agencies and tax industry leaders today warned tax professionals to be alert to an email scam from cybercriminals posing as clients soliciting their services. A new variation of this phishing scheme is targeting accounting and tax preparation firms nationwide. The scheme's objective is to collect sensitive information that will allow fraudsters to prepare fraudulent tax returns. These latest phishing emails come in typically two stages. The first email is the solicitation, which asks tax professionals questions such as ""I need a preparer to file my taxes."" If the tax professional responds, the cybercriminal sends a second email. This second email typically has either an embedded web address or contains a PDF attachment that has an embedded web address. In some cases, the phishing emails may appear to come from a legitimate sender or organization (perhaps even a friend or colleague) because they also have been victimized. Fraudsters have taken over their accounts to send phishing emails. The tax professional may think they are downloading a potential client's tax information or accessing a site with the potential client's tax information. In reality, the cybercriminals are collecting the preparer's email address and password and possibly other information. The IRS urges tax professionals and tax preparation firms to consider creating internal policies or obtain security experts' recommendations on how to address unsolicited emails seeking their services. One tip: Never respond to or click on a link in an unsolicited email or PDF attachment from an unknown sender. As the IRS, states and the tax industry make progress in the fight against identity theft, cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated in their efforts to steal additional client information. Criminals need more data in their effort to impersonate clients and file fraudulent returns to claim refunds, and schemes like this can help in this effort. Read more at Protect Your Clients; Protect Yourself, the Security Summit initiative to increase awareness about the tax professional community.

How do I print a copy of Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, in ProSeries? 

Solution:
When printing a copy of a Form 114 return, the Form 114 will be available as a state or city return selection.
It is also important to remember the Form 114 cannot be printed and filed.  As a result, selecting to print the Filing Copy may not provide you with optimum results.  When printing the Form 114, we recommend using the 'Client Copy', or the 'Preparer Copy' selections which will ensure all pages of the report are printed.  Form 114A will only print with the Client Copy and Preparer Copy of the return.


In ProSeries:  To print Form 114 for your records, or for your client:



From the ProSeries File menu select Print.
In the Print Center window, select the Client Copy or Preparer Copy, or both if you wish.
For the return copy you selected, ensure the checkbox is marked for State/City Returns(s).  To the right of this selection, note the reported value.  If ""All States/Cities"" is reported and you only wish to print the Form 114, click the Choose button and select only 'Foreign Bank Report Form 114' and then click OK.
After making the selections, use the Print Preview option to review the Form 114 on your screen, or click Print to send the Form 114 to your printer.

 


In ProSeries Basic:  To print Form 114 for your records, or for your client:



On the left navigation bar, click Print.
On the Client Copy or Preparer Copy tab, check the box for the Foreign Bank Report Form 114, similar to if you were selecting to print a state return.
Click Print to send the Form 114 to your printer.

 How can I indicate the Form 114 (FBAR) is for a prior year? The IRS will no longer accept earlier versions of FBAR forms once they have been updated. Example: As of September 30, 2013, the former FBAR return, Form TD F 90-22.1, was replaced with Form 114.  As a result of this change, Form TD F 90-22.1 is no longer fileable for any tax year.

Solution Description

 The ProConnect ProSeries software provides the ability to electronically file Form 114 (FBAR) for tax years 2014 and 2015 by completing and submitting the FBAR through the 2014 and 2015 tax year products.


  


 The Form 114 may also be submitted electronically online, for all tax years, via the BSA E-FIling System website.  The BSA E-Filing System website provides filers the ability to enter the calendar year reported, including past years, when completing Form 114 online. It also offers an option to ?explain a late filing,? or to select ?Other? to enter up to 750-characters within a text box where the filer can provide a further explanation of the late filing or indicate whether the filing is made in conjunction with an IRS compliance program"".

 To Open the Worksheet:


Open the return with Educator Expenses
Press F6 to Open the Forms Menu
Type EE and press Enter to open the Educator Expenses Worksheet.


Additional Information:


From ProSeries Tax Help:


 Qualifying educator expenses are unreimbursed amounts spent by an ""eligible educator"" for books, supplies, materials and certain equipment used in the classroom. For courses in health and physical education, only expenses related to athletics are deductible. Qualified expenses do not include expenses for home schooling.

An ""eligible educator"" means a person who is a kindergarten through grade 12 teacher, instructor, counselor, principal, or aide for at least 900 hours during a school year at a school providing elementary or secondary education.
Not more than $250 of qualifying expenses for an eligible taxpayer (and $250 for an eligible spouse if married filing jointly) may be deducted. This amount may be reduced if the taxpayer is excluding interest on Series EE or I U.S. savings bonds on Schedule B, or received a non-taxable distribution from either a Coverdell education savings account or a qualified tuition program.

 Check the box on line 10 if you do NOT want to flow the excess educator expenses on line 9 to Schedule A, Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions Statement. Otherwise, the amount will flow automatically.

Solution:

This situation has been corrected in a ProSeries update that was made available for download on February 26, 2014.

IRS requirements specify that Form 8879 must to be signed prior to electronic filing a return.  However, the 'Submission Identification Number' (associated with field on the Form 8879) will only become available after the client's electronic return is submitted to the IRS by the transmitter.  The IRS does not require the Submission ID to actually appear on the signed Form 8879.  The Submission ID for the taxpayer's return can be associated with the signed Form 8879 by attaching a document that provides that Submission ID.
After the return is accepted, you may print the the ProSeries ""Electronic Filing Client Status History Report"" and attach this report to your signed Form 8879.  The 'Electronic Filing Client Status History Report' contains the taxpayer's SSN, the Submission ID of the return, and provides the 'status history' of the client's return that was filed electronically. 
If you desire, after installing the latest ProSeries software update, you may also return to the client file after the return is accepted, then print the Form 8879  or Form 9325 which may also be attached to the signed Form 8879 to provide the Submission ID.
 


To Print the 'Electronic Filing Client Status History Report':  



Go to your ProSeries EF Center HomeBase, or EF Clients tab in ProSeries Basic Edition.
Highlight the Accepted Federal 1040 return, or returns, that you wish to print the ""Electronic Filing Client Status History Report"" for. 
Go to the ProSeries E-File menu and select Electronic Filing, then Electronic Filing Reports

Why is the Federal form Schedule E for a Vacation Home allowing a loss on line 25?

Information Description

 The Federal form Schedule E is allowing a loss for the Vacation Home per the worksheet in 
 Publication 527, Page 25.


  


Lines 2a through 2d are listing fully deductible expenses that are not limited by the rental income.


   Line 2e instructs to add lines 2a through 2d, and to enter on the appropriate lines of the schedule E. In effect, this makes these expenses deductible to the point where they can generate a loss.
   


   Line 3 instructs to subtract line 2e from line 1, and enter this number on line 3 or to enter 0 if the sum of Line 2e - Line 1 is negative.
   


   Line 3 is then used to limit the remainder of the expense items on the worksheet.
   


 Please note:




   The expenses on the Schedule E input screen are split in 2 columns, a direct and an indirect column, if items are listed in the direct (left) column instead of the indirect (right) column, they will be considered to be fully deductible.
   


   In order to properly calculate depreciation for a Schedule E, the Schedule to be selected needs to be listed as Schedule E (Vacation Home). If just the Schedule E is selected, the depreciation will be allowed in full instead of properly being limited by the Vacation Home Worksheet

2017 Tax Filing Season Begins Jan. 23 for Nation's Taxpayers, Tax Returns due April 18




IR-2016-167, Dec. 9, 2016                                                                             


 


WASHINGTON - The Internal Revenue Service announced today that the nation's tax season will begin Monday, Jan. 23, 2017 and reminded taxpayers claiming certain tax credits to expect a longer wait for refunds.


The IRS will begin accepting electronic tax returns that day, with more than 153 million individual tax returns expected to be filed in 2017. The IRS again expects more than four out of five tax returns will be prepared electronically using tax return preparation software. 


Many software companies and tax professionals will be accepting tax returns before Jan. 23 and then will submit the returns when IRS systems open. The IRS will begin processing paper tax returns at the same time. There is no advantage to filing tax returns on paper in early January instead of waiting for the IRS to begin accepting e-filed returns.


The IRS reminds taxpayers that a new law requires the IRS to hold refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) until Feb. 15. In addition, the IRS wants taxpayers to be aware it will take several days for these refunds to be released and processed through financial institutions. Factoring in weekends and the President's Day holiday, the IRS cautions that many affected taxpayers may not have actual access to their refunds until the week of Feb. 27.


""For this tax season, it's more important than ever for taxpayers to plan ahead,"" IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said. ""People should make sure they have their year-end tax statements in hand, and we encourage people to file as they normally would, including those claiming the credits affected by the refund delay. Even with these significant changes, IRS employees and the entire tax community will be working hard to make this a smooth filing season for taxpayers.""


The IRS also reminds taxpayers that they should keep copies of their prior-year tax returns for at least three years. Taxpayers who are changing tax software products this filing season will need their adjusted gross income from their 2015 tax return in order to file electronically. The Electronic Filing Pin is no longer an option. Taxpayers can visit IRS.Gov/GetReady for more tips on preparing to file their 2016 tax return.



April 18 Filing Deadline



The filing deadline to submit 2016 tax returns is Tuesday, April 18, 2017, rather than the traditional April 15 date. In 2017, April 15 falls on a Saturday, and this would usually move the filing deadline to the following Monday,  April 17. However, Emancipation Day, a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, will be observed on that Monday, which pushes the nation's filing deadline to Tuesday, April 18, 2017. Under the tax law, legal holidays in the District of Columbia affect the filing deadline across the nation. 


""The opening of filing season reflects months and months of work by IRS employees,"" Koskinen said. ""This year, we had a number of important legislative changes to program into our systems, including the EITC refund date, as well as dealing with resource limitations. Our systems require extensive programming and testing beforehand to ensure we're ready to accept and process more than 150 million returns.""


The IRS also has been working with the tax industry and state revenue departments as part of the Security Summit initiative to continue strengthening processing systems to protect taxpayers from identity theft and refund fraud. A number of new provisions are being added in 2017 to expand progress made during the past year. 



Refunds in 2017



Choosing e-file and direct deposit for refunds remains the fastest and safest way to file an accurate income tax return and receive a refund.


The IRS still anticipates issuing more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days, but there are some important factors to keep in mind for taxpayers.


Beginning in 2017, a new law requires the IRS to hold refunds on tax returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit until mid-February. Under the change required by Congress in the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act, the IRS must hold the entire refund, even the portion not associated with the EITC and ACTC, until at least Feb. 15. This change helps ensure that taxpayers get the refund they are owed by giving the IRS more time to help detect and prevent fraud.


As in past years, the IRS will begin accepting and processing tax returns once the filing season begins. All taxpayers should file as usual, and tax return preparers should also submit returns as they normally do, including returns claiming EITC and ACTC.


The IRS will begin releasing EITC and ACTC refunds starting Feb. 15. However, t
he IRS cautions taxpayers that these refunds likely won't arrive in bank accounts or on debit cards until the week of Feb. 27 (assuming there are no processing issues with the tax return and the taxpayer chose direct deposit). This additional period is due to several factors, including banking and financial systems needing time to process deposits. 


A
fter refunds leave the IRS, it takes additional time for them to be processed and for financial institutions to accept and deposit the refunds to bank accounts and products. The IRS reminds taxpayers many financial institutions do not process payments on weekends or holidays, which can affect when refunds reach taxpayers. For EITC and ACTC filers, the three-day holiday weekend involving President's Day may affect their refund timing.


'Where's My Refund?' on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go phone app will be updated with projected deposit dates for early EITC and ACTC refund filers a few days after Feb. 15. Taxpayers will not see a refund date on 'Where's My Refund?' or through their software packages until then. The IRS, tax preparers and tax software will not have additional information on refund dates, so 'Where's My Refund?' remains the best way to check the status of a refund.



Help for Taxpayers



The IRS reminds taxpayers they have a variety of options to get help filing and preparing their tax return on IRS.gov. Taxpayers can also, if eligible, locate help from a community volunteer. Go to IRS.gov and click on the Filing tab for more information.


Seventy percent of the nation's taxpayers are eligible for IRS Free File. Commercial partners of the IRS offer free brand-name software to about 100 million individuals and families with incomes of $64,000 or less.


Online fillable forms provides electronic versions of IRS paper forms to all taxpayers regardless of income that can be prepared and filed by people comfortable with completing their own returns.


Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) offer free tax help to people who qualify. Go to irs.gov and enter ""free tax prep"" in the search box to learn more and find a nearby VITA or TCE site, or download the IRS2Go smartphone app to find a free tax prep provider.  


The IRS also reminds taxpayers that a trusted tax professional can provide helpful information and advice about the ever-changing tax code. Tips for choosing a return preparer and details about national tax professional groups are available on IRS.gov.



Renewal Reminder for Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINS)



 


ITINs are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number. Under a recent change in law, any ITIN not used on a tax return at least once in the past three years will expire on Jan. 1, 2017. In addition, any ITIN with middle digits of either 78 or 79 (9NN-78-NNNN or 9NN-79-NNNN) will also expire on that date.


This means that anyone with an expiring ITIN and a need to file a tax return in the upcoming filing season should file a renewal application in the next few weeks to avoid lengthy refund and processing delays. Failure to renew early could result in refund delays and denial of some tax benefits until the ITIN is renewed.


An ITIN renewal application filed now will be processed before one submitted at the height of tax season from mid-January to February. Currently, a complete and accurate renewal application can be processed in as little as seven weeks. But this timeframe is expected to expand to as much as 11 weeks during tax season, which runs from mid-January through April.


Several common errors are currently slowing down or holding up ITIN renewal applications. The mistakes generally center on missing information, and/or insufficient supporting documentation. ITIN renewal applicants should be sure to use the latest version of Form W-7, revised September 2016. The most current version of the form, along with its instructions, are posted on IRS.gov.

Attempting to Log Into Lacerte 2016 the Program Closes (32-bit System),https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000024983_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+14%3A44%3A16+UTC,0,2017-08-10 14:44:16,Last Modified 254 days ago,"Description
When attempting to log into Lacerte 2016, the program closes after entering your login credentials. This issue will occur if you are running Lacerte 2016 on a Windows 32-bit system.  The steps in this article pertains to 32-bit computers only.  If you are on a 64-bit computer, do not perform the steps in this article.
 
 

Before You Begin:
How do I know if I'm running on a 32-bit system? There are two quick ways of determining whether or not you're running on a 32-bit system;
Option 1: Using the prior year TY2015 Lacerte Program

Open your TY2015 Lacerte Program.
Hit your F10, function key available on your keyboard.
Select the System Information tab within the Technical Support Information window.
View the Operation System Version listed here.  You will see either 32-bit or 64-bit.  

 


Note: If you see 64-bit no action is required on your part.  If you do not see a reference to a 64-bit system, you have a 32-bit computer.  Proceed to Step #1 if you have a 32-bit computer.

Option 2:  Windows Article Link


How to determine whether a computer is  running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system. (this link will take you to a Microsoft support webpage)


Solution #1
Attention! If you are currently experiencing this issue, please download Release 3 that was made available for download on 1/5/2017 as this update may help resolve the issue.
To download Lacerte 2016 Release 3:
Type the following command including the quotes   

Press Windows + R keyboard to open the Run dialog box.

""C:\Program Files\Common Files\Lacerte Shared\websetup16.exe""

Follow the prompts on the screen to install the update.
When the installation is complete, try logging into Lacerte 2016.

If the problem persist after installing Release 3, go to Step #2.

Solution #2
Modify the amount of memory that is allocated to the 2016 Lacerte calculation engine by modifying the Jx.Config file. The default is 256 mb  and this will lower the amount of memory that the calculation engine will use.
Modify the Jx.Config.

Browse to the local directory where the program is installed. In most cases it is C:\Lacerte\16tax.
Locate the JX.CONFIG-TEMPLATE file.
Right-click and rename it to JX.CONFIG.
Double-click on the file and choose Select the program from a list option.
Click OK.
Select Notepad from the Programs list.
Uncheck the box, Always use the selected program to open this kind of file.
Click OK.
Find the top line value that reads -Xmx384m and change the value from 384 to 224.
Click on File.
Click on Save and close the Notepad file.
Open the Lacerte 2016 program and test for functionality.

If the problem persist, repeat the steps above and decrease the 224 value by 16 until the problem no longer occurs.


NOTE: Do not attempt a value lower than 128.  If you set the value to 128 and the issue continues, contact technical support.


 

Workaround


 Microsoft has described the steps below as a workaround to 32-bit operating systems only having access to 2 GB of memory for applications.




Warning!




These steps should be performed by IT personnel with the operating system installation disk available:  It is important to note that performing these steps could cause system instability as it is taking memory away from the kernel. If you implement these steps, you accept responsibility for the results. Intuit is unable to guide you through either implementing these steps or removing them.Important Note: You must run bcdedit.exe with administrative permissions. If BitLocker encryption is enabled, you must suspend it, make the change, reboot the system, and then re-enable Bitlocker.  Make sure that your IT person has the BitLocker recovery key printed out or saved on a separate file not on your current hard drive


An alternative to Solution #2, you can  run the Bcdedit command.  The Bcdedit command will increase the virtual address space that is available to applications up to 3 GB. Lacerte 2016 defaults to using 256 MB of virtual memory for its calculation engine. 

(Click to expand instructions for your version of Windows)


Windows Vista and Windows 7


Go to Start button.
Go to All Programs and then Accessories.

Right-click on Command Prompt and click Run as administrator.
Run the following command:

bcdedit /enum

Under Windows Boot Loader look for the following entry:

increaseuserva with a value of 3072

If you do not see it, then run the following command:

bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072
 

Then restart the computer.



Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10


On the Start Screen, type Command Prompt.

Right-click on the Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
Run the following command:

bcdedit /enum

Under Windows Boot Loader look for the following entry:

increaseuserva with a value of 3072

If you do not see it then run the following command

bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVa 3072



Restart the computer.





Additional Information:


What does the bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072 command do?

Reporting an Education Distribution Form 1099-Q in the Individual Module,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000032482_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+14%3A44%3A24+UTC,0,2017-08-10 14:44:24,Last Modified 254 days ago,"Problem Description
A Form 1099-Q reporting an education distribution was issued to the taxpayer and needs to be reported on the 1040. Where can this be entered in Lacerte?

Solution Description

 To report an Education Distribution / payment from a 1099-Q:


  


Go to Screen 14.3, Education Distributions (ESAs & QTPs).
Enter the information related to the distribution under the Education Distributions (1099-Q) section:  
  
Enter the Higher education (net of nontaxable benefits).  *Note- The amount of qualified expenses MUST be input in Higher education (net of nontaxable benefits) (Code 143) in order to show the distribution as nontaxable.  Enter qualified education expenses for tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment required for the enrollment or attendance of the beneficiary at an eligible educational institution. Also include reasonable costs for room and board while attending the eligible institution if the beneficiary attended at least half time. Do not include expenses that were paid from nontaxable benefits such as nontaxable scholarships or grants. The program uses qualified expenses to offset earnings on the ESA and QTP distribution worksheets. If the taxpayer or spouse received multiple distributions from ESA's or QTP's, the expenses entered in this field will be allocated to the ESA's and QTP's according to Pub. 970 instructions. In this case, it is not necessary to enter higher education expenses for each ESA or QTP.  Enter the total expenses in the first ESA or QTP for the taxpayer or the first ESA or QTP for the spouse.  
Enter the Elementary and secondary education (net of nontaxable benefits).
Enter the Gross Distribution (1) (1099-Q box 1).
Enter the Earnings (2) (1099-Q box 2).
Enter the Basis (3) (1099-Q box 3).
Enter a '1' or '2' in, Rollover : 1=nontaxable, 2=taxable (4).  Note:  Enter 1 if the ESA or QTP distribution was a nontaxable rollover. Enter 2 if the distribution was a taxable QTP rollover. If the distribution is a nontaxable rollover, it will not be included in the return. If the distribution is a taxable QTP rollover, the earnings portion of the distribution will be included in income on the tax return and subjected to the 10% penalty in Part II of Form 5329.  Refer to Pub 970 for information regarding the taxability and non-taxability of ESA and QTP rollovers.  
Enter a '1', '2', or '3' in, 1 = private 529 program, 2 = state 529 program, 3 = Coverdell ESA (5) (1099-Q box 5).  Note:  Enter 1 if this distribution is from a private section 529 program, 2 if from a state section 529 program, or 3 if from a Coverdell Education Savings Account.  
 
Click on Add from the left navigation panel to add more 1099-Q distributions.

Note:  If the distribution becomes non-taxable, there is a strong likelihood that a notice will be received by the client indicating amounts as taxable. In order to avoid this, be sure to utilize Screen 47, Notes to illustrate to the IRS that the distribution was absorbed by the expenses, and therefore completely non-taxable. To indicate the distribution was absorbed and not taxable:

Go to Screen 47, Notes.
Select Statement from the left navigation panel.
Enter the information regarding the 1099-Q distribution and expenses incurred.

Once the statement has clearly indicated that the distribution was completely used up, it will indicate to the IRS just what occurred with the distribution. This is necessary due to the fact that the IRS is notified of the distribution, but does not have any knowledge as to what the distribution was used for, or how much was used.
 
Lacerte does not have specific input for the following boxes, please refer to the Form 1099-Q instructions for how to treat these items:
Box 4 - Trustee-to-Trustee Transfer Checkbox - In a trustee-to-trustee transfer between qualified education programs, the distributing program must provide you with a statement reporting the earnings portion of the distribution within 30 days of the distribution or by January 10th, whichever is earlier. You must properly account for this in computing the earnings or (loss) reported in box 2 and the basis reported in box 3.

Box 6 - If this box is checked, the recipient is not the designated beneficiary.

 
Note:  In situations where the client received a 1099-Q distribution and is claiming education expenses via form 8863, be sure that the expenses that are on Screen 38.1, Education Credits/Tuition Deduction (Screen 38 in 2013 and prior years) and on Screen 14.3, Education Distributions are not the same. The education expense amount that was used for the 1099-Q distribution, should not be the exact amount used for form 8863. Only the amount of the education expenses, that remain after being used against the distribution, can be claimed as education expenses for form 8863. If information is reported inaccurately, it could also prompt the receipt of a notice from the IRS.
Example-
The Taxpayer incurred $27,000 worth of education expenses and they received a distribution amount of $26,000 on their 1099-Q. The full amount of the education expenses cannot be indicated in both Screen 14.3, Education Distributions and Screen 38.1, Education Credits/Tuition Deduction. Only the education expenses over the amount of the distribution can be used on Screen 38.1, Education Credits/Tuition Deduction (Screen 38 in 2013 and prior years). In this example, only $1000 would be able to be reported as education expenses on form 8863.  GEN64154"

Basis Limitations for K-1 Losses,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000023307_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-21+21%3A01%3A02+UTC,2,2018-04-21 22:26:48,Last Modified 254 days ago,"Description
Information on Basis Limitations for K-1 Losses.

Detailed Information

Definition

The basis limitation is a limitation on the amount of losses and deductions that a partner of a partnership or a shareholder of a S-Corporation can deduct. The basis limits are the first of three limitations that are applied to Schedule K-1 losses and deductions. After the basis limits are applied, the At-risk limits (Form 6198) are applied. If losses are allowed by the basis and at-risk limits, the passive limits (Form 8582) are applied, if applicable.
Per Schedule E (1040), shareholders of S Corporations are required to attach a basis calculation to their tax return each year. There is no form for the basis limitation, but a worksheet, and some instructions have been provided in the partner and shareholder instructions for Schedule K-1.
It is important to note that the capital account shown on the Partner's K-1 is not the same as basis. According to the Partner?s Instructions for Schedule K-1, the basis schedule represents outside basis while the capital account represents inside basis. These can differ, even when the partnership maintains its books and records on a tax basis. One way this difference can occur is when a partner buys his partnership interest from another partner, since the purchase price becomes the starting point for his outside basis. (For more information on general K-1 issues, please see K-1 Issues for Individual Taxpayers, General)

Computation

The starting point for the basis limitation is adjusted basis at the beginning of year. The adjusted basis at the beginning of the year is the ending adjusted basis from last year reduced by loss allowed in the previous year. In the initial year, basis is equal to the adjusted basis of property contributed to the partnership, plus any gain recognized on the contribution of property.
The following adjustments are made to arrive at the beginning adjusted basis used in applying the basis limitation:

INCREASES:

Adjusted basis is increased by current income from the activity, additional amounts invested in the activity, and depletion in excess of the oil and gas property basis.
Additionally, the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership includes the partner's share of the partnership?s liabilities. This is not the case for shareholders in an S-Corporation. Because the S-Corporation is a corporation, it is a distinct legal entity separate from the shareholder, so the shareholder does not increase his or her basis by their share of liabilities. The shareholder only increases their basis by the loans they make directly to the corporation.

INCREASES TO SHAREHOLDERS' DEBT BASIS:

Once losses have reduced a shareholder's stock basis to zero, basis in loans that the shareholder has made to the S-corp is used to allow losses. In future years, any net increases increase debt basis before stock basis. It is important to note ""Net Increases"" is determined by netting together current year income, losses, prior year losses and distributions. If prior year losses are in excess of current year income, there is no ""net increase"" and therefore no restoration of debt basis. For more information, please see IRC. 1367(b)(2)(B)).

DECREASES:

Distributions, decreases in a partner?s share of partnership debt, and repayments on loans the shareholder made to the S corporation are all reductions to a partner's or a shareholder's basis.
If the current year plus prior year disallowed losses exceed basis, some of the loss is disallowed. Any disallowed loss is carried to the following year return and is treated as incurred in the following tax year.
For partners, the allowed loss is allocated pro-rata to each category of loss or deduction (Ordinary, 1231, capital gains/losses, 179 expense, etc). For shareholders, there are ordering rules. Nondeductible expenses and depletion are allowed in full first, unless the shareholder has filed an election to do otherwise. (Regulation 1.1367-1(f))

Distributions in excess of basis

Per Internal Revenue Code Sections 704(a)(2) and 1367(a)(2) basis can never fall below zero. If there has been a distribution in excess of basis, then gain has to be recognized on the distribution. This gain is not reported on schedule K-1. The partner/shareholder reports the gain on their tax return.
Per Internal Revenue Code Section 1368, the treatment of a distribution in excess of stock basis depends upon whether or not the S-Corporation has any earnings or profits from when it was a C-Corporation.
If there were no earnings and profits, then any amount distributed in excess of stock basis is considered gain from the sale or exchange of property. IRC. 1368(b)(2)). The character of the gain is dependent upon the holding period of the S-Corporation stock.
If the S-Corporation had earnings and profits from when it was a C-Corporation, then, per Internal Revenue Code section 1368(c) the following rules apply:
A. The portion of the distribution that does not exceed the accumulated adjustments account is treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of property.
B. The portion of the distribution remaining after step A above is treated as a dividend to the extent it does not exceed accumulated earnings and profits of the S corporation.
C. Any distribution remaining after applying the two steps above is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.
For partners, Distributions in excess of basis also results in gain. (IRC. 731(a)(1)) Any gain recognized is considered gain from the sale of exchange of the partnership interest. See Internal revenue code section 731 for how to determine the character of the gain.

Alternative Rule for computing partnership basis

In circumstances where the general rule for computing a partner?s basis cannot be practicably followed, an alternative method of computing basis may be available. This alternative method computes the partner?s basis by referencing the partner?s share of the adjusted basis of partnership property they would receive upon termination of the partnership. (See Regulation 1.705-1(b) for more details about the alternative rule).

How does Lacerte calculate the Form 8962 in conjunction with the SE health insurance deduction?

Solution Description
If Form 8962 is generating with a Premium Tax Credit and you have a SE health insurance deduction on 1040, line 29 your deduction and credit may be adjusted by the calculations described in Rev. Proc. 2014-41.
Important! If the amount of SE Health Insurance deduction entered on Screen 24, Adjustments to Income is the same amount entered on Screen 39.2, Form 1095-A, you will need to remove the amount from Screen 24, Adjustments to Income before completing the steps below. Only enter on Screen 24, Premiums not entered elsewhere.
To have Lacerte calculate the SE Health Insurance Premium in conjunction with the PTC:

Go to Screen 39, Affordable Care Act Subsidy/ Penalty.
Click on Form 1095-A - Health Insurance Marketplace Statement from the top left navigation panel.
Select the applicable 1095-A from the middle left navigation panel (if multiple).
Scroll down to the SE Health Insurance Deduction section.
Select the applicable Form (Ctrl+T) from the drop down menu.
Select the applicable Activity name or number from the drop down menu.
Enter the Related activity start month (if applicable).
Enter the Related activity end month (if applicable).

 

 

FAQs-How is Lacerte coming up with the amounts for the SE Health Insurance Deduction and PTC?

There is not one correct answer for how much SE Health Insurance Deduction and PTC to take. The basic rules are to reduce the SE Health Insurance Deduction by the PTC amount so the return is not doubling the deduction and to reduce the premiums paid by any advanced payments. You may use any calculation method you want that satisfies the requirements of the tax law. 
Per Rev. Proc. 2014-41 Section 3. Scope,
""Using the calculations in this revenue procedure is optional.""
 
Why are the amounts different on the return after a recent update? 

With the 3/18/2015 update Lacerte added the Self-employed Health and Premium Tax Credit Reconciliation calculation to the 1040, line 29 worksheet. This calculation shows how Lacerte is coming up with the Health Insurance Premiums on line 1 of the worksheet.    
With the 3/25/2015 update Lacerte added the Simplified Method calculation from Pub 974. 
With the 3/25/2015 update Lacerte updated the Iterative Method to follow Pub 974 worksheets exactly.
With the 4/8/2015 update Lacerte updated the Simplified Method calculation. See Simplified Method of SE Health Insurance Between ACA and SE Health Deduction for more information.

Important Information concerning Electronically Filed Returns and the April 18th deadline:

Popular questions this time of year include:


Does my electronically filed return need to be ""Accepted"" by the filing deadline?
If my return is timely filed, but I receive a Rejection, what do I do?

When you electronically file a return or extension, an electronic postmark is applied when it's received at the Intuit Electronic Filing Center. This electronic postmark is similar to the postmark a return would receive when mailed at the post office. The IRS honors the Intuit Electronic Postmark as proof of timely filing when the return is received by the IRS within 48 hours of the submission date and time.  While your return must still be accepted to be considered filed, that acceptance does not need to be received by the filing deadline.  If the return is Rejected, a ""perfection period"" is available to correct and resubmit the return.  Perfection period guidelines will define how quickly you must respond to the Reject to maintain the return's ""timely filed"" status. 

The basic guidelines for ""perfecting"" a rejected return are:


Timely submitted Individual income tax returns and extensions that are rejected are provided 5 days to correct and resubmit the return electronically. April 23, 2017 is the last day to retransmit rejected timely filed returns and extensions. 10 days are provided to paper file the return if it cannot be corrected and resubmitted electronically.  
Timely submitted Corporate, S Corporate, Partnership, Fiduciary and Tax Exempt returns that are rejected are provided 10 calendar days to correct and resubmit the return electronically, or be filed by mail. Extensions are provided only 5 calendar days to resubmit, or file by mail.  If you are mandated to file electronically, you must contact the IRS e-Help Desk for assistance in correcting a reject before filing the paper return.  
For ALL return types that are Rejected and will be filed by Paper, include a printed copy of the reject notification, a copy of the Electronic Postmark, and if mandated to e-file, include the appropriate form or explanation specifying the reason the return was not filed electronically.  For more information, see Paper Filing a Timely Filed Rejected Electronic Return After the Tax Filing Deadline.

The limit is $50,000 if married filing separately. An example of this type of mortgage is a home equity loan used to pay off credit card bills, buy a car, or pay tuition.

ACA Coverage Considered Unaffordable Exemption Code A FAQs,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000024296_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+15%3A12%3A42+UTC,0,2017-08-10 15:12:42,Last Modified 254 days ago,"Description
Coverage is considered unaffordable - Was the amount you would have paid for employer-sponsored coverage or a bronze level health plan (depending on your circumstances) more than eight percent (8.05%) of your actual household income for the year as computed on your tax return?
Beginning tax year 2015, the Lacerte program can calculate if healthcare is affordable based upon a few additional inputs.  The ACA Interactive Affordability calculator is also available as a resource to you to quickly calculate affordability apart from input in the tax program. Note: The calculator is provided as a resource only and does not take the place of the program calculations.  
ACA Interactive Affordability and Tax Penalty Calculators      Claim an Affordability Exemption  Source: Healthcare.gov


To use the in-program calculator, take the steps listed below.

Step 1.  Enter tax information as you normally would in the Lacerte program, for example, Wages in Screen 10 and other information provided by the client. Note:  Enter the total of all nontaxable social security benefits received by you, spouse and each claimed dependent who must file a tax return. 
Step 2.  If your client indicates that they did not purchase insurance because it was unaffordable and they had no access to employer-based insurance, you will need to determine what the 2015 Bronze Plan and Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan premiums for the client were.  If they do not have that information, you can obtain this from the Healthcare.gov website using the Claim an Affordability Exemption link. 
Step 3.  Enter the requested information in the Healthcare Coverage Tax Tool link above and this will provide you with the Bronze Plan and SLCSP premiums for the household.
Step 4.  In the Lacerte program in Screen 39.1, Health Coverage, Exemptions, & Misc. in the section labeled Coverage Considered Unaffordable (Exemption Code A), enter the Bronze Plan Premium and Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan (SLCSP) in the January input field  The screenshot below shows an example of healthcare plan input.  
Step 5. Note:  If the Healthcare tool provided the same plan premium amount for all 12 months, you need enter only the January amounts, then check the ""Premium entered for January applies to entire year"".



Step 6. You can click the Forms tab to view the Marketplace Coverage Affordability results in the Worksheets section.  The program calculates the 8.05% household income amount at the bottom of the worksheet.  Compare the Line 13 amount to the threshold value.
Example 1:  Single taxpayer with $35,000 household income who did not have coverage for the entire year and did not have access to employer-based coverage.  Using the premium amounts in the screenshot above,  Marketplace coverage total premiums would be $1,884 for the entire year.  Based upon program input the 8.05% threshold is $2,818.  Since $1,884 is below $2,818, coverage is considered affordable and the taxpayer is subject to the Individual Penalty.
Example 2:  Single taxpayer with $48.000 household income who did not have coverage for the entire year and no access to employer based coverage.  In this scenario, the taxpayer exceeds the 400% Poverty Threshold and so does not qualify for premium assistance.  As a result, the full cost of the Bronze Plan premiums of $4,668 exceeds the 8.05% threshold of 3,864 so coverage is considered unaffordable.  The program automatically generates a Form 8965 with the Exemption Code A.
 
Affordability ExemptionHow to claim this exemption:
Method 1: When filling out the return (Form 8965, Part III):In this instance you can claim an exemption directly on the tax return, reported on Form 8965. In the Lacerte program, at the Detail tab, click Screen 39, Affordable Care Act Subsidy/Penalty. In Screen 39.1, under the ""Coverage Exemptions for Individuals Claimed on Returns (Form 8965, Part III) enter the Name and Social Security Number for each taxpayer and family member covered under this exemption. In the ""Exemption Type"" field, select ""Coverage is considered Unaffordable"" from the dropdown menu. An application is not required if claiming the exemption under Part III of the form and can be used to claim an exemption for the entire year or part of the year.
If the taxpayer is claiming this exemption for the full year, enter a 1 in the Full Year field. If coverage was unaffordable for only part of the year, enter a 1 in the applicable months. This will generate an entry in Part III of the 8965 with an exemption Type of A and display a full year or partial year exemption for the shared responsibility tax penalty. VIew Article
Method 2: By applying for an exemption (Form 8965, Part I):Time-saving tip: Instructions indicate to use this form for months in the future. An application for an exemption for the entire calendar year would need to have been filed before the beginning of 2015 which is the reason why an Affordability Exemption application for 2015 is not available on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid site (cms.gov). After Jan. 1, 2015 use Method 1 above to claim in Form 8965, Part III. If a marketplace exemption for tax year 2015 was filed prior to January 1, 2015, after the application has been processed and approved, enter the Exemption Certificate number with the taxpayer and members of household SSN in Screen 39.1 in the Market Granted Exemption section which will then appear in the Form 8965, Part 1 section.

This information does not proforma from year to year.  This input is intended to be used as identification verification and must be entered each year.


Additional Information:


Q1. Why am I being asked for my driver?s license number?


A1. In an effort to better protect you from identity thieves, some states will be trying new approaches. Some states may ask for additional identification information, such as your driver?s license number, when you are preparing your state tax return. This will be another layer of protection because identity thieves may already have your name and Social Security number, but perhaps not your driver?s license number. States requesting this information have the ability to match driver?s license information and other identifying records to help confirm your identity.  Note: This information does not proforma from year to year.  This information is intended to be entered as identification verification, and should be entered each year.
 


Q2. Do I need to enter a driver's license to file my Federal Tax return?


A2. Beginning in Tax Year 2016 the Federal return requires an 'identity verification level' to be assigned to each electronic return.  The requirement is set when the Taxpayer Identity Verification is selected.  When 'Identity Not Verified' or 'State-Issued ID' is indicated, additional inputs are Not required for Federal e-file. 
The identity verification level is determined by the Taxpayer Identity Verification selection made in Screen 1, Taxpayer  Authentication section, and must be marked to calculate the appropriate identity verification level.

FAQs


What is the purpose of Fast Path? 

Fast Path represents the service component of your Lacerte Tax offering and is required as part of your software license.  Services include e-file, access to product/technical support and My Account (downloads, account maintenance). For a complete list of all services, refer to Included in Fast Path Services above.   
 

Do I have to purchase Fast Path?

Yes, Fast Path is required for each licensee. 
    
Customers with an Auto Renew date after December 31st may experience a slight delay in services until the order is processed.
 
Fast Path replaces the REP License that may have been on your invoice in prior years.
For Network users, Fast Path replaces the concurrent network users that were formerly purchase in blocks of 4. 
    
Fast Path purchases are purchased for each active network user.
 
Fast Path replaces several items that may have been on your invoice in prior years, and had varying service periods, including: REP License, Lacerte Network License, Unlimited Business E-File, and REP e-File fees*.
 

What else do I need to know about Fast Path? 

The TY2016 Fast Path service period is January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. As long as you renew by December 31 of each year, you will not experience an interruption or change in services.
 

What if I have not renewed Lacerte for tax year 2016 by December 31, 2017? 

You will be able to use your program to prepare and file paper returns for any unlimited modules purchased. The login requirements implemented for Tax Year 2016 enable program access. If you do not renew your program, you will lose access to Fast Path services, including REP access, e-filing capability, live support and program updates.
 

Why did Lacerte separate Fast Path services from the Tax Program?  

In the past, we delivered the tax year program that was used for E-Filing from January to October, at which time, we stopped supporting the tax program.
With multi-year E-file, that same Tax Program can be used to E-file for up to 3 years.
Based on customer feedback, we are updating our service periods to support renewed customers with the services they need.
 

The Tax Program will continue to be available on a perpetual basis to customers who choose not to renew, but we will not provide services to support their tax program.

Fiduciary Diagnostic Deductions from Form 1041 are Reducing Income (Ref. #10901),https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000038545_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+16%3A43%3A02+UTC,0,2017-08-10 16:43:02,Last Modified 254 days ago,"The following informational diagnostic is generating;
   
 

   
 

Deductions not attributable to one class of income have reduced the distributable income in one or more classes of income. Please see the DNI Diagnostic for further details. (ref. #10901)



  


  


Solution Description

 This informational diagnostic generates when deductions have reduced more than one class of income.  The class or classes of income being reduced are based on the K-1 Deductions method selected.
 
 



Tier Allocation - This method applies the deductions to different classes of income ahead of others until the deductions are used in full. After making an appropriate allocation to tax-exempt income, deductions are first allocated to interest, dividends, and other income, then to the extent that any remain, to passive income. Using tier allocation preserves the amount of passive income passed through to the beneficiaries so that it can be used to offset passive losses from other sources.
   
 

Pro-Rata Allocation - This method allocates a percentage of the total deductions to a particular class of income equal to the same percentage that the particular class of income bears to the total income. For example, if interest income is 10% of the total income of the trust, then 10% of the total deductions are allocated to interest for Schedule K-1 allocations.
   
 


  


To View or Change Which Method is Selected for A
 ll Clients:


Click on Settings.
Click on Options.
Select the Tax Return tab.
Scroll down to the K-1 Distribution Options section.
Locate the K-1 Deductions option.
Select the applicable option from the drop down menu: 
  
Tier allocation
Pro-rata allocation
 
Click OK which will apply change.




 To Change the K-1 Deductions Method for a Specific Client:

Go to Screen 44, Deduction Allocation for DNI.
Locate the DNI Allocation Options section.
Enter a 1 or 2 in, Automatic allocation: 1 = tier, 2 = pro-rata [O]. 




 

 To View the 
 DNI Diagnostic Schedule:


Click on the Forms tab.
Click on DNI Diagnostic.

This will show where the deductions are being applied and which class/classes of income are being reduced. The ""Total"" column should reflect the same amounts on the 1041, page 1.

  


  



 


  
  


Additional Options Available on Screen 44:


  



Allocate charitable deductions to capital gains - This reduces the capital gains distributed to beneficiaries by virtue of an allocable portion of charitable deductions.

Allocate non-charitable deductions to capital gains - This reduces the capital gains distributed to beneficiaries by virtue of an allocable share of deductions. If you leave this field blank, the program does not allocate any deductions to capital gains.

Optimize qualified dividends (only use with tier allocation) - When this option is selected, the qualified dividends have deductions allocated to them after all other types of income (e.g. interest) except for capital gains.  If this option is not selected (or pro-rata deduction allocation is used) then expenses are allocated to the qualified dividends by the proportion of qualified dividends to total dividends.

Attaching PDF Documents to an E-file Return in the Lacerte Program,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000037900_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+15%3A12%3A54+UTC,1,2017-08-10 15:12:54,Last Modified 254 days ago,"How do I attach a PDF Document to a return for electronic filing in the Lacerte program?

Beginning with the Tax Year 2015 program, Lacerte offered the new PDF Auto-Attach Capability for e-file returns. This feature provides additional convenience and time-savings to your firm.
The PDF Auto-Attach feature will attach forms generated by the program that are required to be part of the electronic return as a PDF.  This powerful feature works in conjunction with our extensive set of diagnostics to determine when a form attachment is required, generate that form as a PDF and include with the electronic return when electronically filed.
The following video will show you just how easy the PDF Auto-Attach feature is to use and why we are so excited to provide to you in the TY15 program.



Note: The Auto Generate and Attach PDFs to EFiles option can be turned off.

Go to the Settings drop down menu.
Select Options.
Within the Setup Tab, Switch Auto Generate and Attach PDFs to EFiles to 'No'.

This may be necessary in some situations where the auto generate and attach is interfering with manual PDF attachment options.
For TY14 and prior year returns, all PDFs are manually attached to the return prior to being electronically filed. 

*NOTE- 
  At this time, Lacerte supports the transmission of PDF attachments for the following returns:




Individual (see Attaching PDF Documents to a 1040 for more information)
Partnership

Corporation 
S-Corporation
Exempt Organization 
Fiduciary 
Benefit Plan



  


 To attach a PDF to a return:


  


Scan the document and create a PDF file. (If PDF is not already on your computer.)  *NOTE- For optimal results, we recommend scanning in black and white and no higher than 300 DPI.  
Go to the Electronic Filing screen: 
  

Screen 4 (Partnership)

Screen 4.2 (Corporate)

Screen 3.2 (S Corporate)

Screen 5 (Exempt Organization)

Screen 2.2 (Fiduciary)

Screen 4 (Benefit Plan)  
 
Click on PDF Attachment.    *NOTE- For Exempt Organization click on the '1' from the left navigation panel under the e-file Attachment section  
Click on Attach PDF.    
Click Browse Files or Browse DMS (depending on where the file is saved) to locate and select the PDF version of the file. 
Click Open.
Click OK.    *NOTE- The name of the PDF should now appear in the Description of file field. The PDF is now attached to the return.  
Select the form/type to link the attachment to from the Link to form (defaults to main form) drop-down menu.    
Select the Activity name or number (e.g. 3=3rd Form 3115) (Ctrl+T) (if applicable).    
Verify that the 'Yes' button is selected under Send PDF attachment with federal return (If applicable see note)  Note: The Send PDF attachment with federal return will not appear when e-filing a Federal Only return, or when filing with states that do not support PDF attachments.  
Click on Add from the left navigation panel to add additional PDF Attachments.
Repeat Steps 4-9 for each additional attachment.

Note: Attaching PDFs to State returns is the same process as attaching PDFs to the Federal Return. If the state allows PDF attachments there will be a separate section for the state. Check the box, Send PDF attachment with [STATE] return and select the appropriate option or enter the Form and line number on state return (this input varies for states).
Note: E-File attachments are limited to a combined size of 32 MB.  This means you can have as many attachments as needed but the combined size of the attachments cannot exceed 32MB.   While 32 MB is the maximum combined size, you could experience issues transmitting the EF return at around 20 MB.  If you are having difficulty transmitting an EF return with attachments that are ~ 20 MB in combined size, we recommend reducing the size of the PDf(s).
If you have PDFs created from scanned documents, you can reduce their file size by scanning in black and white/grayscale or monochrome and by reducing the DPI (dots per inch) when scanning.

Remove attached PDFs from the return.
Reduce the size of the PDF's by re-scanning them in B&W at 200-300dpi.
Attach the new PDFs and e-file the return.

Additional Information:

Do not attach any documents that require IRS approval or attention.
If the taxpayer is signing the return using Form 8453-C , a signed copy must be attached prior to transmission of the return.
After the PDF is attached to the return, the original PDF document can be moved or deleted and it will not affect the return.

    Any gain from these sales is taxable as a capital gain. A wash sale occurs when the taxpayer sells or trades stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale the taxpayer:

Buys substantially identical stock or securities,
Acquires substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade, or
Acquires a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities.




Box 6 Check if a noncovered security

    If this box is checked, the securities sold were noncovered securities and boxes 1b, 3, 5, and 8 may be blank. Generally, a noncovered security is a security other than stock; stock purchased before January 1, 2011; stock in most mutual funds and other regulated investment companies; and stock held in a dividend reinvestment plan in 2011. Securities acquired before the effective date for their respective category a considered ""Non-covered"" and have different requirements for cost basis reporting. Noncovered securities are entered as if they were standard Sch D transactions, the only difference is the cost basis may not show on the 1099-B and the preparer may have to contact the taxpayer to gather that information.
   


Box 8 Type of gain or loss.  Short-term or Long-term

    The program will automatically determine this based on the 
    Date Acquired and 
    Date Sold.  An override is available in the

You can create a new client file but when you use ""Save As"" the tax program will also crash and stop responding.


Solution
There are occasions when the ""shared form"" files (i.e. SHRFRM15), located in C:\BasWin15\Common\, will become corrupted and cause the symptom described above.  Renaming these files usually corrects this issue and will enable Basic Edition 2015 to access its client files.  For steps on how to rename the shared form files, reference ""Unable to Read the Data"" Error Accessing All Client Files in ProSeries.
If renaming the shared form files does not correct this situation, then there is a possibility a Windows .Net component may have become corrupted or was improperly installed during a Windows system udpate. 
In the example below, a couple of updates to .Net version 4.6.1 was the source of the 'access' problem, which caused an 'unhandled exception' error whenever .Net was attempting to access Basic Edition's client database.  Once the updates were removed functionality returned to Basic Edition and clients could be accessed again.  We do not recommend uinstalling .Net components if you are not familiar or comfortable with the technology.  Instead, we suggest contacting a local technician to help you with repairing this important Windows component.

 Foreign Income may be reported in multiple ways:


On a W-2 form or 1099-R
Not reported on either a W-2 or 1099-R but on a Foreign Form/Letter.

How are these amounts entered?

Solution Description

 There are two separate methods of entering foreign wages for exclusion on Form 2555 (lines 19 through 23, 
 except for line 20): 




   Enter the Foreign Wages on the 
   W-2 Worksheet or the 
   Wages, Salaries & Tips Worksheet and mark them as Foreign Wages.
   


 If entered in this manner, the Foreign Wages will flow first to the 
 2555 Income Allocation Worksheet, line 19c, and then to Form 2555, line 19, 


OR




   Enter the Foreign Wages 
   directly on the 
   2555 Income Allocation Worksheet ( 
   NOT on Form 2555) and check the box in the 
   Flow Foreign Wages to Form 1040 Smart Worksheet on the 
   Form 2555 Income Allocation Worksheet.
   


 If entered in this manner, no wages will flow to the Form 2555 from the 
 W-2 Worksheet or the 
 Wages, Salaries & Tips Worksheet EVEN IF they are marked as Foreign. The amount from the 
 Form 2555 Income Allocation Worksheet, Line 42, column A, minus lines 20a and 20b, column A, will flow as income to the 
 Wages, Salaries & Tips Worksheet, Line 9.


  


NOTE:
Do not use a combination of the two methods and verify that all Foreign Income is properly reported on Form 1040.


  


 If there is 
 NOT an 
  X in the 
 Flow Foreign Wages to Form 1040 Smart Worksheet above, the program transfers Gross W-2 wages marked as Foreign Source from the 
 Worksheet PLUS entries made on the 
 Wages, Salaries & Tips Worksheet, Line 8b if the box is checked on line 8c, to line 19c.


  


 If Foreign Wages are entered elsewhere in the return, enter the amount(s) on lines 19a and 19b of the 2555 Income Allocation Worksheet.

The higher education expenses and the tuition and fees expenses are from Form 1098-T, box 2.  What are the ""...nontaxable benefits""?

From Publication 970:

 Tax-free educational assistance includes:


The tax-free parts of scholarships and fellowships.


 A scholarship or fellowship is tax free only if:


You are a candidate for a degree at an eligible educational institution, and
You use the scholarship or fellowship to pay qualified education expenses.

So, ""nontaxable benefits"" would be the tax-free portion of any scholarship amounts that appear in Form 1098-T, box 5.  The amount in 1098-T, box 5 should reduce the amount in 1098-T, box 2 and the result will be entered in above-mentioned fields.

To resolve this situation:



Temporarily disable anti-virus and other significant third party applications (i.e. backup program).
Download the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (32-bit).  The file name of this download is vc_redist.x86.exe.

Run the vc_redist.x86.exe file.  If an Uninstall button is displayed, select this option and proceed with Step 3.  If only an Install button is displayed, select this option and then skip to Step 4 when complete.
When the unistall is complete, again run the vc_redist.x86.exe and select Install.

When complete, restart your computer.
When the computer has restarted, verify the issue has been resolved.

When entering a Distribution in excess of Retained Earnings, the Schedule M-2, line 7 only enters the Distribution up to the amount of Retained Earnings.

Solution Description

 Open the 
 Schedule M-2 / Retained Earnings Worksheet, and scroll down to the 
 Schedule M-2 / Retained Earnings Memo Smart Worksheet, line 
 G. This is the amount of Distributions in excess of Retained Earnings.


  


Distributions in excess of Retained Earnings


 Calculated on this line are distributions in excess of those allowable from retained earnings. (i.e. The amount of distributions entered on the Schedule K, Shareholders Distributions and Dividends Smart Worksheet, line A, is greater than the allowable distribution amount available in retained earnings.)


  


 You may need to adjust the end of year balance in another Schedule L account, such as capital stock, to bring the end of tax year balance sheet into balance.


  


 For certain circumstances you can force ProSeries to allow the distributions on the Schedule M-2 by completing the following steps:


Print the Schedule M-2 for reference.
On the Schedule M-2 check No to the question ""If Yes, use automated Schedule M-2/Retained Earning Worksheet amounts?"". This will cause ProSeries to not complete the Schedule M-2 automatically.
Scroll back up to the Shareholder Distributions and Dividends Smart Worksheet and remove the amount entered here.
On Form 1120S, page 3-5, line 16d, enter the amount of the distribution.
Using the previously printed Schedule M-2 for guidance, manually enter the Schedule M-2.
After completing the Schedule M-2 entries, manually enter the end of year retained earnings on Schedule L, line 24.

How do I compare married filing joint between married filing separate on an individual return?

Solution Description

 Please 
 Note: ProSeries Basic Edition does not have the Married Filing Joint vs. Married Filing Separate Worksheet.  The married filing joint (MFJ) versus married filing separate (MFS) worksheet can be used to compare the different filing status.


  


 To access  this worksheet:




   Press the 
   F6 key on your keyboard.
   


   Type in 
   MFJ, this will highlight the MFJ vs. MFS Wks.
   


   Click 
   OK.
   


   Check the box to calculate the form.
   

Note: TSJ indicators must be enabled and tax return items must be allocated to either the taxpayer, spouse, or  joint for the information to flow to correctly.
To enable TSJ Indicators:



   Click on the 
   Tools menu button.
   


   Click on 
   Options.
   


   In the 
   General section under Form Indicators, check the box to 
   Show TSJ Indicators. In the clients return, you can now allocate tax return items between taxpayer, spouse or joint.
   

 

 If you wish to file the returns married filing separate, you can split the return by using the 
 Split MFJ Return feature:




   From the 
   HomeBase.
   


Highlight the file that you would like to split.
   


   Click on the 
   File menu button.
   


   Choose 
   Split MFJ Return.
   


   In the Split MFJ Return box, make sure both the taxpayer and spouse box is checked. You can also change the file name for each by typing in a new file name in the file name box.
   


   Click 
   OK.
   


   There will now be a separate federal/state return for both of the taxpayer and the spouse.
   

Verify the information in both returns.
 

Note: The ProSeries Basic Edition program does not support the MFJ vs. MFS Worksheet, or the ability to spilt an MFJ return automatically.  Please see

 Need information on 529 Contributions and Form 1040


 Need information on 529 College Savings Program


 Need information on 529 Deduction


Solution Description

From IRS Tax Topic 313 - Qualified Tuition Program (QTPs)


  


 A Qualified Tuition Program (QTP) also called ""529 plan"", formerly called a Qualified State Tuition Program (QSTP), is a program established and maintained by a state, or agency or instrumentality of a state, to allow either prepaying, or contributing to an account established for paying a student's qualified higher education expenses at an eligible educational institution. Eligible educational institutions can establish and maintain QTP(s) to allow prepaying a student's qualified higher education expenses.


An eligible educational institution is generally any college, university, vocational school, or other post secondary educational institution eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the Department of Education.
  


 Contributions to a QTP on behalf of any beneficiary cannot be more than the amount necessary to provide for the qualified higher education expenses of the beneficiary. 
 Contributions made to a QTP are not deductible on your Federal tax return.


  


Note: 1099-Q distribution information can be entered in 
 Screen 14.3, Education Distributions.


The benefits of establishing a QTP are; earnings accumulate tax free while in the account, and no tax is due on a distribution that is used to pay qualified higher education expenses. The beneficiary generally does not have to include in income any of the earnings from a QTP unless the amount distributed is greater than the beneficiary's qualified higher education expenses.

Frequently Asked Questions:

What is the Identity Verification Worksheet?

New for Tax Year 2016 and as part of the partnership between the IRS and state agencies to combat identity theft and tax fraud, a significantly increased focus has been placed on developing ?trusted customer? features that will help ensure the authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return. Collectively through the Security Summit, state agencies and the IRS identified the need for additional information to be collected and provided with the electronic return.  Without the additional information, state agencies lack access to databases available to the Federal government (Ex. Social Security Administration) which can restrict states' ability to protect against fraud.  As a result, the IRS implemented new identity verification data elements to be submitted with the electronic return.  Through the collection of driver?s license and state ID information, data is now readily available to state taxing agencies and can shared at the state level. As a professional tax software vendor, we are required to implement the collection of the identity verification data that is reflected in the ProSeries Identity Verification worksheet.
The IRS and state agencies, along with industry partners, continue to work together to analyze and share data to combat fraud income tax fraud.  Processing protocols that are used to identify fraudulent returns have and will continue to evolve significantly throughout the season and into the future.  These protocols utilize a variety of data to identify potentially fraudulent returns that require review.  While unfortunate, valid returns can be flagged as suspicious and require review which results in delays. The Driver's License and State ID information, when provided, offers additional data the agency can use to identify the taxpayer and the return as being authentic.
While some state agencies indicate identity verification data such as driver?s license and state ID info may not ""required"", this data is still available to the state tax agencies and can be used to prevent a return from being flagged for review, or if flagged can speed the processing and release of a taxpayer's refund.  As the Identity Verification Information is a protection provided to the taxpayer, we encourage you to allow your tax client to determine if they wish to provide the information.
 

Does this impact the Federal return? 

Specific data captured in the Identity Verification Worksheet is required to be present in the taxpayer's electronic return.  The ProSeries 'Final Review' and error checking will alert you to missing information that is required to be present. 
The Federal return requires an 'identity verification level' to be assigned to each electronic return return.  The identity verification level is determined by the boxes checked the Documents Used to Verify section - one of the following selections must be marked to calculate the appropriate identity verification level. 

Driver's license
State issued identification card
No Driver's License or State ID

When Driver's license or State issued identification card is marked, additional detail concerning the license or identity card must be entered.  When No Driver's License or State ID is indicated, additional inputs are Not required.
 

Is this information required?  
If I don't provide this information, will my client's return be delayed? 

The IRS does not use this information for identity verification purposes, but elements of the identity verification data must be present for the electronic Federal return to be properly formatted.  Improperly formatted returns can be rejected.  
The Identity Verification Information is provided to the state agencies through the taxpayer's Federal and state return. The state agencies will utilize the data by matching against state databases in an effort to authenticate the taxpayer's identity and the validity of the income tax return when required. 
If the taxpayer's identity verification information is missing, some states may reject the return.  While most state agencies will not reject the return, the taxpayer's return can be delayed when identity verification information is not present and the authenticity of the return is in question.
Please Note - New York state has indicated that 'No Driver's License or State ID' should Not be used when the taxpayer possesses a Driver's License or State ID. Alabama state requires a Drivers License or State ID for all electronically filed returns.
By accurately completing the identity verification information, you assist the tax agencies by providing additional data that can be used to confirm authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return. As a reminder, the identity verification information serves as a level of protection to avoid delays in processing the taxpayer's return.  If you (as the tax preparer) make the decision on behalf of your tax client, or make a business decision to not collect the driver's license or state ID detail, you must mark the 'No Driver's License or State ID' box located in the ""Documents used to Verify Taxpayer (Spouse) Identity"" section. 
 

Once verification information is entered into my client's data file, will this data transfer from year to year? 

Unfortunately, the Identity Verification Information will Not transfer from year to year.  Since collection of this information is implemented as a precaution to protect against fraud, the taxing agencies require this information to be confirmed with the taxpayer, and re-entered each tax year.

Depreciation Recapture Section 1250,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000037916_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-20+22%3A26%3A51+UTC,1,2018-04-21 22:29:56,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Description
Depreciation Recapture on Section 1250 Property:Part or all of the gain on the sale or other disposition of Section 1250 property may be treated as ordinary income. For Section 1250 property held more than one year, the amount of gain generally treated as ordinary income is the lower of the following:

The applicable percentage times the portion of the additional depreciation attributed to periods after 1975.

OR

The applicable percentage times the total gain.

The applicable percentage used depends on whether the real property being sold or disposed is nonresidential real property, residential rental property, or low-income housing property. The date placed in service of these properties will determine the percentage that needs to be used. See IRS Publication 544 page 28 for the appropriate percentages. If Section 1250 property is held longer than one year, the additional depreciation is the excess of actual depreciation over the depreciation figured using the straight-line method. If the property is held for one year or less, all the depreciation taken is additional depreciation. There is no additional depreciation or depreciation recapture if a straight-line method is used.

Resolution:
When entering the sale or disposition through Screen 22 Depreciation the program uses the depreciation method* entered to determine what type of property the asset is.*Note:  The program does not recapture depreciation for section 1250 real property (methods 85 and 87) or straight-line methods (71, 81, 89, and 83). For ACRS accelerated real property methods (70, 80, and 82), the program recaptures the excess of accelerated depreciation over straight-line.When entering the sale or disposition through Screen 17 Disposition the Depreciation Allowed entry (Code 30) should include any prior year and current year depreciation for the asset. This number will flow to Form 4797 Page 2 Line 22. Also, the depreciation recapture entry (Code 31) must be entered if the property is any type of property other than Section 1245. To correspond with this depreciation recapture entry there must also be a property type entry (Code 74). The property type entry will take the depreciation recapture entry and place it on the appropriate line (26a, 27a, 28a, or 29a) of Form 4797 Page 2. GEN50109"

How do I enter 1099-DIV Box 8, Cash Liquidation Distributions and Box 9, Non-cash Liquidation Distributions information?

Solution Description


  The cash and non-cash liquidation distributions are generated when a corporation is partially or completely liquidated, and represent a return in capital investment. This amount should be 
  treated as capital gain to the extent that it exceeds the initial basis of the investment. Basis of the investment must be tracked by the taxpayer.
 


Currently Lacerte does not have a specific input field for 1099-DIV boxes 8 and 9.


  


 To enter 1099-DIV boxes 8 and 9:


  


Go to Screen 17, Dispositions to enter the transaction.
Enter the amount shown in Box 8 or Box Box 9 as the Sales Price (code 27).

Enter the known basis amount as the Cost or Basis (code 29).
Enter the date of the basis investment if known in Date Acquired (code 25) or enter a negative date for Various.


   Enter the 
   date the corporation was liquidated as 
   Date Sold (code 26) or enter negative date for Various. 
  



      If necessary, use the 1 = short term, 2 = long term [O] (code 51).
     
 

The IRS provides this guidance to aid the Preparer in entering this information. It comes from Pub 550, pages 21, 22
Liquidating Distributions:  Liquidating distributions, sometimes called liquidating dividends, are distributions you receive during a partial or complete liquidation of a corporation. These distributions are, at least in part, one form of a return of capital. They may be paid in one or more installments. You will receive Form 1099-DIV from the corporation showing you the amount of the liquidating distribution in box 8 or 9. Any liquidating distribution you receive is not taxable to you until you have recovered the basis of your stock. After the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, you must report the liquidating distribution as a capital gain. Whether you report the gain as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends on how long you have held the stock. See Holding Period in chapter 4.
Stock acquired at different times:  If you acquired stock in the same corporation in more than one transaction, you own more than one block of stock in the corporation. If you receive distributions from the corporation in complete liquidation, you must divide the distribution among the blocks of stock you own in the following proportion: the number of shares in that block over the total number of shares you own. Divide distributions in partial liquidation among that part of the stock that is redeemed in the partial liquidation. After the basis of a block of stock is reduced to zero, you must report the part of any later distribution for that block as a capital gain.
Distributions less than basis:  If the total liquidating distributions you receive are less than the basis of your stock, you may have a capital loss. You can report a capital loss only after you have received the final distribution in liquidation that results in the redemption or cancellation of the stock. Whether you report the loss as a long-term or short-term capital loss depends on how long you held the stock. See Holding Period in chapter 4. GEN52564"

How does the program calculate MACRS depreciation?

Straight line Method
Straight-line depreciation is done by taking the basis and dividing it by the life of the asset, thus for a 7-year depreciable asset, 1/7 of the basis will be allowed in depreciation each year until it is fully depreciated.
Note:  The program will calculate other limiting factors such as business use percentage before applying auto limits.

Declining Balance Method
The percentage depreciation is based on a 200% declining balance calculation:
Depreciation = ( Previous Year Non-Depreciated Basis / Life of Asset ) x 2
When straight-line depreciation for the remaining years (taking into consideration that Year 1 is a half-year) would equal or exceed the declining balance depreciation, the depreciation shifts to straight-line for all remaining years.
For example: an asset that has a 5-year life with a purchase price of $5,000 would depreciate as such:

Year 1 (half year):  ( $5,000 / 5 ) x 2 / 2 = $1,000Year 2:  ( $4,000 / 5 ) x 2 = $1,600Year 3:  ( $2,400 / 5 ) x 2 = $960Year 4:  ( $1,440 / 5 ) x 2 = $576   **Year 4 SL: $1,440 / 2.5 = $576**, so the straight line calculation begins hereYear 5:  $1,440 / 2.5 = $576Year 6 (half year):  ( $1,440 / 2.5 ) / 2 = $288$1,000 + $1,600 + $960 + $576 + $576 + $288 = $5,000

Note:  The first and last year's depreciation are half-year calculations, so the allowable depreciation has to be divided by 2 in those years. INF22247"

If the premium amounts exceed 8.13% of household income, then healthcare coverage is considered unaffordable.  Use Exemption Code ""A"" in the program to claim the exemption.
 
The Affordable Care Act specifies if the taxpayer does not have access to employee only or family only health plans they must use the Marketplace Affordability worksheet to determine healthcare affordability.

Marketplace Coverage Affordability Worksheet Calculator - 


Enter the Taxpayer Modified AGI and Dependent MAGI to obtain Total Household Income in the Affordability Worksheet section.
Click the 2016 Bronze Plan Premium link for access to Healthcare.gov which will provide access to the ""Claim an Affordability Exemption"" tool. This will provide both the lowest cost bronze plan and Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan for use in the calculator.
Access the 2016 Silver Plan link for Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan costs used to calculate the monthly client cost. You can also get this amount accessing the ""Claim an Affordability Exemption"" tool in healthcare.gov. 


NOTE: Both Bronze Plan and Silver Plan premiums are required in order to correctly calculate the contribution amount.


Verify that total household members from the drop-down selection. The default selection is 1. 
Verify the appropriate Federal Poverty Level table based upon taxpayer resident state. The default selection is 48 states and DC.
The remaining values are automatically calculated. The automated input field enters the monthly contribution amount in each month and totals the result.  If the total is greater than 8.05% of total household income, coverage is not considered affordable and an exemption can be obtained on that basis. 
The calculator will add together the monthly premium costs and divide them by the Total Household income to determine the affordability of the coverage and displays  ""Affordable"" or ""Not Affordable"" beside the line labeled Coverage Indicator.
If the premium amounts exceed 8.05% of household income, then healthcare coverage is considered unaffordable.  If coverage is considered affordable, review the remaining exemptions for the individuals in the household to reduce or eliminate the healthcare penalty.  The ACA Interactive guide provides a comprehensive list of exemptions to review and choose from.  Note: In addition to the existing Manual Input field which allows you to adjust household income up or down as you determine, an additional input field has been added that allows you to enter the total of non-taxable Social Security Benefits received by the taxpayer, spouse and each claimed dependent who must file a tax return. This amount is subtracted from MAGI for the purposes of calculating the 8.05% threshold. 
A manual input field is provided to enter household income up or down, enter partial months and situations where the monthly premium may vary from month to month, for example if a client has moved to a new location.

Form 1099-S Entering Proceeds From Real Estate Transactions,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000040549_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-21+16%3A13%3A38+UTC,1,2018-04-21 22:30:54,Last Modified 254 days ago,"Where do I enter amounts from Form 1099-S?

Reportable Real Estate
Generally, you are required to report a transaction that consists in whole or in part of the sale or exchange for money, indebtedness, property, or services of any present or future ownership interest in any of the following:
 1. Improved or unimproved land, including air space.
 2. Inherently permanent structures, including any residential, commercial, or industrial building.
 3. A condominium unit and its appurtenant fixtures and common elements, including land.
 4. Stock in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in section 216).
 5. Any non-contingent interest in standing timber.


  


Sale or exchange


 A sale or exchange includes any transaction properly treated as a sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes, even if the transaction is not currently taxable. For example, a sale of a main home may be a reportable sale even though the transferor may be entitled to exclude the gain under section 121. Also, a transfer to a corporation that qualifies for nonrecognition of gain under section 351 is a reportable exchange. In addition, a transfer under a land contract is reportable in the year in which the parties enter into the contract.


  


 Box 2 - Shows the gross proceeds from a real estate transaction, generally the sales price. Gross proceeds include cash and notes payable to you, notes assumed by the transferee (buyer), and any notes paid off at settlement. Box 2 does not include the value of other property or services you received or will receive. See Box 4.


 Box 3 - Shows the address or legal description of the property transferred.


 Box 4 - If marked, shows that you received or will receive services or property (other than cash or notes) as part of the consideration for the property transferred. The value of any services or property (other than cash or notes) is not included in box 2.


 Box 5 - Shows certain real estate tax on a residence charged to the buyer at settlement. If you have already paid the real estate tax for the period that includes the sale date, subtract the amount in box 5 from the amount already paid to determine your deductible real estate tax. But if you have already deducted the real estate tax in a prior year, generally report this amount as income on the ""Other income"" line of the appropriate income tax form. For more information, see Pub. 523, Pub. 525, and Pub. 530.

Form 4562: Depreciation and Amortization, Line 12, how do I clear the 1040 Error Message: ""You Must Fix This Error. You have elected Section 179 on multiple activities, or have a Section 179 deduction on a K-1 activity. The total amount of Section 179 you may deduct has been limited. You must reallocate the Section 179 on one or more activities. See Tax Help for Form 4562, line 12 for the details""?


  





Solution Description

Section 179 and One Activity


If only one activity is claiming the Section 179 deduction, ProSeries  computes the Section 179 deduction and any limitation in Part 1 of Form 4562 for that activity.
Each business activity has its own Form 4562 (there is a 4562 for Schedule C, a 4562 for  Schedule E, Schedule F, etc.).
Allocate allowable Section 179 on Form 4562, Line 12 Smart Worksheet for that activity.

 Section 179 and Multiple Activities

   
 


  


ProSeries generates Form 4562: 179 Limitation if the taxpayer has Section 179 deductions for multiple activities, or has pass-through Section 179 deduction entered on a Schedule K-1 (Partner or S Corp).
Business income limitation for the current year is calculated on line 11.
Line 12, Section 179 expense deduction is limited to amount on line 11.
Figure out which activities have elected 179 and then allocate the amount of 179 among those activities.
Allocate allowable Section 179 deduction on Form 4562, Line 12 Smart Worksheet for each activity.

 

IF THE ONLY SECTION 179 ENTRIES ARE DERIVED FROM K-1 WORKSHEETS, PLEASE SKIP THIS SCREENSHOT.


   
 


  


  


 Partnership K-1, 179 adjustments are made on the 
 Schedule K-1 Partnership Additional Information 1, Box 12, Line 2. 


 The Schedule K-1 Partnership Additional Information 1 Worksheet can be accessed by using the 
 QuickZoom below 
 L
ine 12 on the Schedule K-1 Partnership Worksheet.


  





  


S-Corp K-1 pass-through 179 adjustments are made on 
 Schedule K-1 S Corporation Additional Information 1, Box 11, Line 2.


 The Schedule K-1 S Corporation Additional Information 1 Worksheet can be accessed by using the 
 QuickZoom below 
  Line 11 on the Schedule K-1 S Corporation Worksheet.


  





  



NOTE: The Total allowable Section 179 
 must equal line 11 of Form 4562:Section 179 Limitation. If the amount of available Section 179 is greater than the limitation on Form 4562, Line 11, you must allocate the Section 179 to equal the amount on line 11. If the amount of Section 179 allocated is less than the amount on line 11, the error will also appear.


  


NOTE: To help you decide how to allocate the deduction, you may want to review the Section 179 Expense Report.  This report lists the elected Section 179 on new assets and the Section 179 carryovers for all activities.


  


 Since the Section 179 deductions for Form 2106 vehicles are reported separately from the Section 179 deduction for all other Form 2106 assets, you must specify how much of the allowable amount you are allocating to each vehicle by entering it on Form 2106, Line 31 Smart Worksheet,  line B.


  





  


 Then you must enter the amount you are allocating to all other Form 2106 assets on Form 2106 Adjustments Worksheet, Depreciation Information Smart Worksheet, line D.


  





  


 If you are manually completing Form 4562 for this return, and the taxpayer has multiple activities with a current year Section 179 deduction, you must manually complete Form 4562: Section 179 Summary to compute the limitation.  In that case, do not make any entries in Part I of any other Form 4562, except for the Form 4562, Line 12 Smart Worksheet. This form is calculated only if there is a current year 179 deduction  for more than one activity, or there is a pass-trhough Section 179 deduction from a partnership or S corporation.

 
Note: For the error ""1040 Carryover Worksheet Total Section 179 Carryover Does Not Match the Sum of the Section 179 Carryovers"" please refer to 1040 Carryover Worksheet Total Section 179 Carryover Does Not Match the Sum of the Section 179 Carryovers. GEN49239"

Schedule A Itemized Deductions Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premiums,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000036598_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+17%3A15%3A42+UTC,0,2017-08-10 17:15:42,Last Modified 254 days ago,"Problem Description
From the Schedule A, line 13 instructions:

Enter the qualified mortgage insurance premiums you paid under a mortgage insurance contract issued after December 31, 2006, in connection with home acquisition debt that was secured by your first or second home.  See Prepaid mortgage insurance premiums on this page if you paid any premiums allocable to any period after the close of the tax year.  Box 4 of Form 1098 may show the amount of premiums you paid in 2009.  If you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if filing jointly) were liable for and paid the premiums in connection with the loan, and the premiums were reported on Form 1098 under the other person's SSN, report your share of the premiums on line 13.


Qualified mortgage insurance is mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Housing Administration, or the Rural Housing Service, and private mortgage insurance (as defined in section 3 of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 as in effect on December 20, 2006).


Mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Rural Housing Service is commonly known as a funding fee and guarantee fee, respectively.  These fees can be deducted fully in 2009 if the mortgage insurance contract was issued in 2009.  Contact the mortgage insurance issuer to determine the deductible amount if it is not included in box 4 of Form 1098.


Prepaid mortgage insurance premiums.  If you paid qualified mortgage insurance premiums that are allocable to periods after the close of the tax year, you must allocate them over the shorter of:


The stated term of the mortgage, or

84 months, beginning with the month the insurance was obtained.


The premiums are treated as paid in the year to which they are allocated.  IF the mortgage is satisfied before its term, no deduction is allowed for the unamortized balance.  See Pub. 936 for details.


Exception for certain mortgage insurance.  The allocation rules, explained ab love, do not apply to qualified mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Rural Housing Service.


Limit on amount you can deduct.  You cannot deduct your mortgage insurance premiums if the amount of Form 1040, line 38, is more than $109,000 ($54,500 if married filing separately).  If the amount on Form 1040, line 38 is more than $100,000 ($50,000 if married filing separately), your deduction is limited and you must use the worksheet on page A-8 to figure your deduction.


Solution Description
At this time, there is no way to enter qualified mortgage insurance premiums in the Depreciation screen so that the amortized amount appears on the Schedule A, line 13.  Any amortization entered on this screen will appear on Schedule A, line 23.
To have the correct amount appear on the Schedule A line 13:

Go to Screen 25, Itemized Deductions.

Scroll down to the Interest section.
Enter Qualified mortgage insurance premiums paid on post 12/31/XX contracts.

If you want the program to track the amortization on the depreciation schedule:

Go to Screen 22, Depreciation.

Enter in Description of Property, Date placed in service, and Cost or Basis in the grid at the top.
In the Form dropdown, select an item that is not on the return, such as Oil & Gas Property

By selecting a Form that doesn't exist, the numbers will not be taken to the return, but will appear on the depreciation schedule.
You will get the following Critical Diagnostic which can be ignored as it will not affect the ability to file the return: 
    
Depreciation asset #X:  Sent to nonexistent form or schedule. (ref. #2009263)
 
 
Select 91 = Straight Line from the ""Method"" dropdown.
Scroll down to the Federal Depreciation section.
Find the Regular Depreciation subsection heading.
Enter the Life or class life (recovery period automatic).
Enter the Amorization code section (Ctrl +T). 
  
Since code 163 is not in the list, it can be manually typed in the field.
See IRC Section 163 for more information.
 
Enter any ""Prior depreciation/amortization,"" if applicable.

 Why am I getting the error message that my (Schedule L) balance sheet is out of balance?


Solution Description

 Below are tips and common areas to review when the Schedule L is reported to be out of balance.


  


Forms 1065, 1120s, and 1120:


There is a correct order for completing a business return in ProSeries. It is important to complete the return in this order: 
  
Complete the rest of the tax return,
Complete Schedule M-1,
Complete Schedule M-2,
Complete Schedule L
 
Check to make sure all the numbers have been entered correctly, with no transpositions.
Check your signs: make sure positive and negative amounts are entered correctly.
Make sure the source balance sheet (financial reports) are in balance.
Beginning balances are found on the previous year's tax return as ending balances in Schedule L, column (d), or if this is a new company, from the Financial Report Balance Sheets.
Make sure all assets in the balance sheet are listed as the book balance (Schedule L- Balance Sheet Per Books).
Beginning and ending inventory flow from Schedule A, Cost of Goods Sold.
Confirm accumulated depreciation on depreciable assets. Prior year's accumulated depreciation + Current year's depreciation expense = Total accumulated deprecation.
Retained earnings should include current year's book income or loss.

 


Form 990, Part X:



Check to make sure all the numbers have been entered correctly, with no transpositions.
Check your signs: make sure positive and negative amounts are entered correctly.
Make sure the source balance sheet (financial reports) are in balance.
Beginning balances are found on the previous year's tax return as ending balances in Schedule L, column (d), or if this is a new company, from the Financial Report Balance Sheets.
Retained earnings should include current year's book income or loss.

MFJ / MFS Worksheet Home Office Itemized Deduction Splits Fully to Either Taxpayer or Spouse,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000036806_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+17%3A43%3A58+UTC,0,2017-08-10 17:43:58,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
When Home Mortgage Interest is entered as part of Indirect Expenses on Screen 29, Business Use of Home (8829), the portion calculated as being an Itemized Deduction on the Schedule A does not split equally on the MFJ/MFS Worksheet.  It assigns the entire amount to either the taxpayer or the spouse, whoever had the home office.  Why?

Solution Description
Lacerte assumes that if a part of the Home Mortgage Interest is involved in a Home Office for either the Taxpayer or Spouse, not joint, then the rest of the mortgage interest would also go to that same individual.  Therefore, it assigns the Home Mortgage Interest to either the Taxpayer or Spouse.
 
Workaround:

Calculate the correct amount of home mortgage interest allocable to the Home Office by multiplying the business percentage by the total home mortgage interest paid during the year.  

Enter that amount in Screen 29, Business Use of Home as a Direct Expense.

Enter the remaining portion of the home mortgage interest in Screen 25, Itemized Deductions under the Interest section.  


The amount entered in Screen 25, Itemized Deductions will split evenly between the Taxpayer and the Spouse. GEN75698"

 To enter amounts from a Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, follow the steps below:


  


 Navigate to Screen 14.2 State Refund & Unemployment Comp., etc.
 Select the appropriate Form 1099-G on the left panel or click Add to create a new activity
 Enter the Name of Payer and General information

 Enter the amounts from Form 1099-G depending on type of payment such as unemployment compensation or state and local income tax refunds
 Complete these steps for each Form 1099-G received


  


If the Form 1099-G is received for Unemployment compensation (Box 1 of the Form 1099-G)


Under the Federal Section, Unemployment Compensation subsection, in Total Received (1) enter the amount of unemployment compensation received from box 1 of Form 1099-G, even if the taxpayer repaid an overpayment.
In 20XX Overpayment Repaid, enter the overpaid unemployment compensation received and repaid in that is included in Total Received (Screen 14.2, code 2). This amount prints as a footnote on Form 1040, with the description ""Repayment."" The program reduces the amount entered in Total Received by the overpayment repaid and prints the balance. If the unemployment compensation repaid is for a prior year, refer to the IRS instructions.
In Government program contributions reduction (non-itemizers), enter an amount if applicable. Form 1040 instructions state than if the taxpayer made contributions to a governmental unemployment compensation program, and the taxpayer is not itemizing deductions, the amount reported as taxable unemployment compensation can be reduced by those contributions. This is based on Regulation 1.85-1(b)(1)(iii), which holds that if a governmental unemployment compensation program is funded in part by an employee's contribution which is not deductible by the employee, an amount paid to such employee under the program is not to be considered unemployment compensation until an amount equal to the total nondeductible contributions paid by the employee to such program has been paid to such employee. If the taxpayer is not itemizing, and contributed to such a program, enter the amount of contributions. The amount is subtracted from the entry in Unemployment Compensation and the result is included on Form 1040.




If the Form 1099-G is received for State or Local Income Tax Refunds, Credits or offsets (Box 2 of the Form 1099-G)


Under the section titled Federal, State and Local Refunds subsection, enter the Income Tax refunds, credits or offsets from Box 2 of Form 1099-G. 
In Refunds Attributable to post-20XX ES/extension payments (code 7), if applicable, enter the amount of prior year state and local income tax refund attributable to payments made after 12/31/20XX. Refer to IRS Publication 525 for more information regarding the amount to enter here. If this return was transferred to the current year using the prior year program, the amount is automatically carried to this field. The amount entered reduces the taxable amount of refund entered in State and Local Income Tax Refund, Credit or Offsets (2) (Screen 14.2, code 4), and also reduces the amount of state and local income tax deduction of federal Schedule A.
If applicable, check City or Local Income Tax Refund, if this Form 1099G item is a refund of city or local (not state) income taxes. The entry is necessary for certain state returns that must differentiate between a state income tax refund and a city or local income tax refund. As an example, the state of Oregon does not tax Oregon income tax refunds, but taxes income tax refunds from Oregon localities.
Enter an amount in Property tax refunds if received.  Entries are also required in the State and Local Tax Refund Worksheet input section of Screen 14.2 to determine the taxable amount of the property refund. If this return was transferred from the prior year's Lacerte program, the property tax refund amount(s) were carried here automatically, as well as the amounts for the State and Local Tax Refund Worksheet. The taxable amount of property tax refunds is treated as an itemized deduction recovery and reported on Form 1040 as ""Other Income,"" per IRS Publication 525.
If this Form 1099-G was issued for a state and local income tax refund, and there is a tax year other than the most recent prior year in box 3, enter the year from box 3 in YYYY format in Tax year for box 2 if not 20XX (3). The refund entered on this 1099-G will be included in the state tax refund worksheet in the computation of the amount of refund that is taxable this year. The taxable amount of refunds may need to be overridden in this situation. Refer to Pub. 525 for more information regarding refunds received from a year other than 2010.
Under the Form 1099-G section on the left hand column ""State Refund Wksht"" line in blue.





    
  

   Or click on the ""State Refund Wksht"" button located at the upper left hand corner of the detailed portion of the input.
  

    
  




    
  

Complete the entries under Refunds Taxable in 20XX Worksheet.  This information transfers automatically from the prior year during the proforma process.




Itemized in 20XX check box - If the taxpayer did not itemize deductions in the prior year, it is not necessary to make entries here - none of the state or local tax refunds, or property tax refunds entered in the Form 1099-G will be taxable.
The program assumes that the greater of State and local income taxes paid (screen 14.2, code 105) or Allowable general sales tax deduction (screen 14.2, code 110), was deducted on the prior year's Schedule A. If the lower of the two amounts was deducted, an entry in this field will override the program's automatic calculation. If income tax was deducted even though the sales tax deduction was higher, enter numeric 1 in this field. If sales tax was deducted even though the income tax deduction was higher, enter numeric 2 in this field.  

Amounts from 20XX Return - Enter amounts from the prior year tax return if the taxpayer itemized deductions in the prior year and received a state or local income tax refund or a property tax refund.  The amounts entered in these input fields are used with state and local refunds and property tax refunds entered in the Form 1099-G input section, to compute the amount of prior year refunds that are taxable in the current year.




    
  

Note: Entries in the ""Income tax refunds, if itemized last year [O]"", code 20 will override the 1040, line 10 and suppress the worksheet and any automatic calculations





Additional entries:



Box 4 Federal Income Tax Withheld - Enter the amount of federal income tax withheld from box 4 of Form 1099-G in Federal Income Tax Withheld (4) (code 6). The amount will be included as withholding in the payments section of Form 1040.

How do I install Lacerte Tax with standalone license?

Solution Description

 Looking for 
 Prior Year Download Info? Try our 
 Download and Install Prior Year Lacerte Tax Programs article.


Important: The 
 2016 Lacerte Tax Program - Release 1 and 
 2015 Lacerte Tax Program - Release (includes Proforma and Organizer) are now available online. To download the programs, login to 
 My Account.  Mouse over 
 My Lacerte and click  
 Downloads. 
  



  


 Watch a 
 video demonstration or follow the steps below to perform a Standalone Installation of the Lacerte Tax program.


  


 With a standalone license, the program needs to be installed to a local drive and usage of network drives for sharing data, backing up data, and sharing program options is not allowed.


  


 Multiple installations of the Lacerte Tax program on a single computer is not recommended.   


  


Installing Lacerte Tax with a Standalone License:


Close any open programs.
Insert the Lacerte Program CD into the CD-Rom drive or Download the program by logging into the My Account website.
Click Next on the Welcome window.   
  
The Installer will check for a year prep (license) file.  If a prep file is found, you will be asked to verify your firm information (2013 - 2016 Lacerte Installers Only). Select one of the following: 
    
Click Yes, if the information displayed is your firm information.
Click No, if the information displayed is not your firm information.  
 
If the prep file is not found or if you clicked No, this is not my firm,  you will see a screen giving you three choices to to install the prep file (depending on the tax year your are installing). Select one of the choices: 
    

Download a Preparer file from My Account - you can provide your username and password to login to My Account and the Installer program will attempt to retrieve the prep file from My Account.

Browse to directory  - If you have a prep file stored somewhere on your hard drive or portable media, you can browse to folder where it resides.

Install a temporary Preparer file - the program uses a demo preparer file and will not display your firm's name on tax returns until the Preparer file is updated. (2008 and prior years only.)  
 
 
Click on the radio button to Accept the license agreement.
Click Next.
Select the programs to install. Note- Only the programs you are licensed for will be displayed (i.e. Lacerte Tax, Tax Planner, etc.). 
Enter the Destination Location where to install Lacerte. Note: This path must end in ??Tax. (""??"" represents the tax year. Example: If installing the 2016 Lacerte Tax program, the path must end in \16Tax)
Click Next.
Select the applicable States and Modules to install from the Select States window. Lacerte will automatically check the state and modules you are licensed for.   Productivity tip: Select only the modules and states that you expect to use. This will save you time when downloading updates and you can always add later if needed.   
  

Note- In 2009 and prior years you will see a Lacerte Update Scheduler window. This enables you to schedule your program updates that will be downloaded from Lacerte. If not enabled at this time, the scheduler can be turned on later.  
 
Review your current settings. Press Back to change any settings or Press Install.
Click Launch to start the program.  We recommend to restart your computer so that the font files can properly initialize. If you start the program and the tax forms appear blank, (forms but no tax input), restart your computer which will resolve the issue.

How do I create and e-mail a password protected PDF to my client within Lacerte?

Solution Description
Beginning in Tax Year 2014, Lacerte has added the ability to include a link to the PDF, in the email. See Generating a Password Protected PDF and Email below for more information.
 

Setting the Password Protection Options


Click on Settings. 
Click on Options.
Select the Setup tab.
Scroll down to the Complete Return - Email  section.   
    
Select both checkboxes, Identification Number and Zip code to include both components, last 4-digits of SSN or EIN and 5-digit zip code, as the PDF password; or,
Select only one check box to include only one component as the PDF password; or,
Select neither checkbox   Note: If neither box is selected then the PDF copy of the return will be e-mailed with no password.     
 
 Click OK to save the settings. 

Each tax module has its own Password Options and the password settings can vary between modules.



Setting the Firm Level Password for Email PDF

Beginning in Tax Year 2013, Lacerte provides a Firm Password for E-mail PDF feature that helps the whole firm to have a single master password to all PDF's created using the Email PDF feature (the PDF would still be protected by the SSN-ZIP password)
To set the Firm Level Password for Email PDF:

Click on Settings.
Click on Options or Master Options. 
    

Note: If Lacerte is installed to a network, the Firm Password feature will be greyed out in Options. Master Options is the only option to access.
 
Scroll down to the Complete Return - Email section.
Enter the Firm Password.    Note: The Hide Firm Password toggle can be used to Mask/Un-mask the firm password.

 



Generating a Password Protected PDF and E-mail


Click on the Clients tab, to view the list of your clients.
Highlight a single client file. 
    

Note: only one password protected PDF return can be sent at a time.
 
Click on Print.
Select Tax Return.
Select one of the supported Print types from the Return section (Select any of these options to generate the Email (password protected PDF).  (Note: In 2012 Lacerte, only Client Copy, Custom Copy and Partial Return was supported)   
    
Client Copy
Custom Copy
Partial Return
Preparer review copy

Check the box, Email (password protected PDF). (The 'Options' link indicates where password settings can be made).    Note: See the instructions below if you would like to Customize the Email Dialog before clicking OK.  
Check the box, Include link to PDF (in 2014 Lacerte Tax and later) (This option is an added feature and is not mandatory).  Note: The option to include a link to the PDF is available until 12/31/2016. By checking this box Lacerte will include a URL link to the tax return in the email. This way the taxpayer will be able to view the return from anywhere.  
Click OK.

After clicking OK, Lacerte will calculate and generate a PDF of the return. Depending upon the type of MAPI compliant email program that you have, an Email will be created automatically containing a Password Protected PDF copy of the client's return.


If the return is also marked for electronic filing, the validation process will occur for the PDF just as if the return was being printed. 
The ""To"" section of your email will be populated with the e-mail addresses from Screen 1, Client Information. For a single return, one email address will appear. For a joint return, where both Taxpayer and Spouse email addresses have been completed, both email addresses will appear in the ""To"" section of the email.
The body of the e-mail will contain password instructions. The password instructions will differ depending upon what password settings were selected in the Settings and Options. If no password options were selected, no steps to unlock the return will be present in the body of the email. 
    

Note: The SSN for an Individual return used in the password will be that of the primary taxpayer.
 
The body of the e-mail will also include a URL to the return if the Include link to PDF option was selected.

 



Customizing the Email Dialog Sent to Clients

Lacerte also offers the ability to customize the Email Dialog to clients beginning in 2013 Lacerte Tax.
To Customize the Email Dialog:

Click the Print dropdown menu.
Select Print Tax Return.      
Check the Email (password protected PDF) in the desired tax return copy and then click Settings.

Click on Customize Email.    
Enter the: 
    
Subject
Salutation
Body
Closing    
 
Click on Preview Email.

Click on Save & Close once email is complete (or Click on Revert to Default to erase your changes).
Click OK to the Print Settings window.
Click OK in the Print Tax Return window to print to PDF.




Sample Default Text of Email with Password Instructions


    
  

Attached is a PDF copy of your Tax Return.


 


The file is a password protected PDF. The password to open the file is based on the following:


 


PASSWORD INSTRUCTIONS


 


The password is made up of:


 


Last 4 digits of your social security number and 5 digit Zipcode


As an example, if you have SSN 123-45-6789 with an address in zip code 98765 the resulting password is 678998765


 


IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PDF READER


If you do not have a PDF reader, you can download the latest Adobe Reader by clicking on the link below. If clicking does not work, copy/paste the URL into your browser window.


http://get.adobe.com/reader


 


Sincerely,


    
  


 
After your client opens the email, they will be prompted to enter a password with the instructions you provided. After entering the password, the return will be available for the client to print



 
The following rules apply:

Only up to the first five characters of the zip code are used.
If the zip codes contain anything that is not a number (ignoring dashes), it will not be used in the password.
The SSN must be at least four digits long before it is used in the password.
If the SSN contains anything that is not a number (ignoring dashes), it will not be used as the password.
SSN dashes are ignored when creating passwords.
If the SSN is less than 9 digits, it is not used as a password. 


Important Information about PDF Password Protection:


Is the password protected PDF encrypted? Yes, using AES 128-bit encryption similar to Adobe PDF encryption. 

Can this PDF be hacked?  Any security can be hacked given a sufficient length of time and the right tools.  The password methodology is hackable, but allows for relative ease of opening by the Taxpayer. There is always a continuum between security and ease of use. At one end is no encryption and high ease of use.  At the other end is complex passwords like ?24bsde$%f*QW43**F!?, sent separately to the recipient, to create high security, but low ease of use. The password methodology was based on feedback from our Tax Preparer customers. 

Is there anything else I should do to protect my client's tax data? We recommend you also mask the SSN on the PDF return. See Content Coming Soon 

Is emailing a password protected PDF as safe as using a portal to deliver tax returns?   Portal security can be very high or not so high, again, depending on how it is set up. However, it is easier to give high security with reasonable ease of use with a portal. 

Can I use a different password methodology to protect PDF's? Not using this feature, but you can create a custom password using DMS. See Send Email Using DMS

At-Risk Limitations for K-1 Losses,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000023299_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-20+14%3A52%3A50+UTC,0,2018-04-21 22:32:19,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Information on At-Risk Limitations for K-1 Losses.

Detailed Information
The at-risk limitations are the second of three limitations applied to income producing activities. It is similar to the Basis Limitation, in that one of the major components of the ""Amount At-Risk"" is the amount invested in the activity. Under the basis limitation, losses are limited to amount invested in the activity. The at-risk limits, on the other hand, limit losses to amounts the investor has actually put at-risk. This can differ from amount invested because of loan guarantees, stop-loss agreements, or nonrecourse loans.
For example, a partner increases his adjusted basis for his share of nonrecourse loans. Nonrecourse loans are loans for which no partner is personally liable. Since the partner is not personally liable for the nonrecourse loans, he is not considered ""at-risk"" for the loan, therefore the amount of losses allowed under the basis limitations will be higher by the amount of the nonrecourse loan. Some nonrecourse loans, called qualified nonrecourse financing, do increase amount at-risk. Qualified nonrecourse financing are loans that are secured by real estate that is used in the activity.
The at-risk limits are computed on Form 6198. In part I of the form, current year income and loss is combined with prior year amounts that were disallowed by the at-risk limitations. Current and prior year loss is allowed to the extent of current year income. Any prior and current year loss in excess of current year income is limited to amount at-risk.
If partner or shareholder distributions cause the amount at-risk to become negative, gain is recognized to the extent losses have been allowed by at-risk in prior years and have not already been recaptured. The amount of at-risk recapture is carried over to following year as a deduction, and will be allowed as a deduction in the following year if the amount at-risk increases. (IRC 465(d))
There is no guidance as far as the character of the at-risk recapture. One approach would be to characterize the at-risk recapture according to the type of losses deducted in prior years. (1231 loss, long-term capital loss, etc).
The at-risk recapture does not increase the partners or shareholders basis. IRC 705(a)(1)(a) spells out the rules for determining the partners basis. It states that the partner's basis is increased by his distributive share of ""A) taxable income of the partnership as determined under section 703(a)"". Section 703(a) defines the taxable income of the partnership. Since the at-risk recapture is not a partnership item, it does not go into the computation of partnership income under 703(a) and therefore does not increase the partners basis

At Intuit, the security of our products remains one of our top priorities. We are committed to helping safeguard customer information. For tax year 2016, new industrywide standards established through the IRS Security Summit process require professional tax software vendors, including Intuit, to validate each individual user?s identity. Intuit is implementing these changes in the ProConnect Tax Online (PTO) software program so that upon every program start or launch, all individual users associated with a firm must log in. 
Here is a summary of the changes for Tax Year 2016: 

Tax Year 2016 software will require a unique login and strong password for each user of the software.

Make sure each user at your firm has a unique login and password that meets the strong password requirements.Strong Password Requirements are as follows:



Use 8 or more characters
Use upper and lower case letters (e.g. Aa)
Use a number (e.g. 1234)
Use a symbol (e.g. !@#$)
 

 

30-minute inactivity log off

Users will be required to login every 24 hours or after 30 minutes of inactivity.  After you have signed into your tax software, you will remain logged into your tax software as long as your computer is active (i.e. using other non-tax programs, actively browsing the internet, printing, etc.). After 30 minutes of inactivity, you will be required to sign back in with your secure password. An example of inactivity would be:  you need to step away from your computer for more than 30 minutes. This new required standard from the IRS Security Summit will be industry-wide in Tax Year 2016 and was designed to provide the same type of protection from unauthorized data access to sensitive financial data as found in the online banking industry.
Because PTO is a cloud based product your work will automatically be saved.

Passwords must be changed every 90 days.

Each user will be prompted to change their password every 90 days.  Enforcing a software password that requires quarterly changes is becoming an industry standard best practice for safeguarding taxpayer data.

How do I report Partnership Schedule K-1, line 13 Code W in the Individual module?

Solution

 Since Line 13, code W is for various other deductions Lacerte does not have a specific entry field for Line 13 code W. The firm who prepared the Partner's K-1 should have included a Description of what the deductions are and instructions on how to report the deductions on the Partner's Individual return.


  


 If the firm who prepared the Partner's K-1 did not provide a Description and/or instructions on how to report Line 13 code W:


Go to Screen 20, Passthrough K-1's.
Select the Partnership from the left navigation panel.
Scroll down to the Separately Stated Income and Deductions section. 
  
To report the deduction as passive:


Locate the First Passive Item subsection.
Hold down Ctrl+E in Other (Ctrl+E).
Enter the Description.
Enter the Amount as a negative number.
Click OK.    This entry will flow to the Schedule E, page 2, Line 28 column (f), ""Passive loss allowed (attach Form 8582 if required)"" (Assuming that the loss is allowed after passive limitations)  or,  


To report the deduction as nonpassive:  


Hold down Ctrl+E in Other nonpassive items (Ctrl+E).
Enter the Description.
Enter the Amount as a negative number.
Click OK.    This entry will flow to the Schedule E, page 2, Line 28 column (h) ""Nonpassive loss from Schedule K-1""
 

 


Common ""Other Deductions"" with this code may include:


Itemized deductions (Form 1040 filers enter on Schedule A (Form 1040)).
Soil and water conservation expenditures and endangered species recovery expenditures. See section 175 for limitations on the amount you are allowed to deduct.
Expenditures for the removal of architectural and transportation barriers to the elderly and disabled that the partnership elected to treat as a current expense. The deductions are limited by section 190(c) to $15,000 per year from all sources.
Interest expense allocated to debt-financed distributions. The manner in which you report such interest expense depends on your use of the distributed debt proceeds. If the proceeds were used in a trade or business activity, report the interest on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040). In column (a) enter the name of the partnership and ?interest expense.? If you materially participated in the trade or business activity, enter the amount of interest expense in column (h). If you did not materially participate in the activity, follow the instructions for Form 8582 to determine the amount of interest expense you can report in column (f). See page 3 in the Partner?s Schedule K-1 instructions for a definition of material participation. If the proceeds were used in an investment activity, enter the interest on Form 4952. If the proceeds are used for personal purposes, the interest is generally not deductible.
Interest paid or accrued on debt properly allocable to your share of a working interest in any oil or gas property (if your liability is not limited). If you did not materially participate in the oil or gas activity, this interest is investment interest reportable as described on page 9 of the Partner?s Schedule K-1 instructions; otherwise, it is trade or business interest. If you did not materially participate in the oil or gas activity, this interest is investment interest expense and should be reported on Form 4952. If you materially participated in the activity, report the interest on line 28 of Schedule E (Form 1040). On a separate line, enter ?interest expense? and the name of the partnership in column (a) and the amount in column (h).
Penalty on early withdrawal of savings. Report this amount on Form 1040, line 30.
Film and television production expenses. The partnership will provide a statement that describes the film or television production generating these expenses. Generally, if the aggregate cost of the production exceeds $15 million, you are not entitled to the deduction. The limitation is $20 million for productions in certain areas (see section 181 for details). If you did not materially participate in the activity, use Form 8582 to determine the amount that can be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040), line 28, column (f). If you materially participated in the production activity, report the deduction on Schedule E (Form 1040), line 28, column (h). The partnership will give you a description and the amount of your share for each of these items.

The following information below indicates why this is the recommended process. 

Although you have the ability to send almost all state returns directly to the state taxing authority, for many states the IRS recommends sending the state return along with the federal return to the IRS. By following this IRS recommendation, you can ensure the federal return is free of errors before the state return gets filed.
If you file the state return directly with the state taxing authority and the IRS rejects the federal return, you will more than likely have to file an amended paper return with the state.
Some states, such as California and Massachusetts for example, can process returns on a standalone basis. There is no need to designate to have these returns sent directly to the agency. The Lacerte processing center will route returns for standalone states automatically, where available.  

NOTE: In the Electronic Filing Wizard: State Selection Screen, states marked with an asterisk (*) will be sent to the IRS with the federal return (recommended). If you want to send the return directly to the state, simply right-click on a state, and then choose. ""Send directly to state tax authority."" INF29406"

 How do I transfer clients from the prior year to the current year?


Solution Description

 Before following the steps below to Proforma your clients. 


  


 Proforma is initiated in the Prior Year of Lacerte and transfers clients to the Current Year. For example, the final (Proforma) version of 2015 must be installed to transfer the clients from 2015 Lacerte to 2016 Lacerte. Make sure to  
 Install the Proforma Release and Next Tax Year program.


  


The 2015 Organizer/Proforma Release (for Tax Year 2016) was made be available for download on 10/27/2016.


  


 To proforma your clients from the prior year program to the current year program:


Open the prior year Lacerte Tax program.
Click on Tools.
Select Transfer Clients (Proforma to 20??).    
Click Next on the Welcome to the Proforma Wizard window. 

Select the process you want to use to transfer your clients:   
  

Transfer all my clients for all modules at once (will transfer all your clients for all installed program modules at one time)

Select specific clients from the [Program Module] Tax program (for more control in selecting the clients you want to Proforma)  (See Proforma a Single or Select Client Files for more information)  
 
Click Next.
Select the Type of Proforma Process   
  
Typical (Recommended)
Custom

Use settings from last time    
The Typical option will transfer your clients to the Lacerte default directories (i.e. C:\Lacerte\13tax).  After you click Next you will be able to review your Proforma Settings before transferring your clients.  To see where your clients are being transferred to, scroll down to the Client Data Destination directory section.      NOTE: If you do not see your clients in the current year program after transferring them, set your data path to the data path that is shown in the Performa Wizard- Review your Proforma Setting. Also, choose All Clients under Views in your client list.  
The Custom option gives the ability to change the Proforma Destination Data Path to another location. To change the destination root directory, click on the Browse... button.  In the section below the Destination Root Directory you will see the subdirectories where your clients will b transferred to.  This is the path where you will find your clients in the current year program after they have been transferred.    The Custom option will also give you a chance to select information you would like to transfer for each client and what information you would like to print after the transfer. By Default Lacerte will check all boxes on the Choose the Information to Transfer for Each Client window and leave all boxes unchecked on the Choose the Information to Print for Each Client window.    
The Use settings from last time option will be available if the Proforma process has been performed already from the computer.  The settings selected are retained by the program for any future Proforma process.  NOTE: If the Transfer all my clients for all modules at once followed by either Typical or Use settings from last time options were selected, then click the Transfer Now button on the following screen that appears to begin the Proforma process of all your client files for all program modules installed.  
 
Review the current settings on the Review Your Proforma Settings window.
Click Transfer Now to begin the Transfer of the clients.  NOTE- Choose one of the following options if an Information window appears, ""Client [Client Name] already exists on [Destination Directory]. Process Client?""

Cancel - will cancel the entire Proforma process.

Yes to All - will overwrite not only the existing client file that is referred to in the message, but any other client file that exists in the Destination Directory location and was selected for Proforma.  
 
The Diagnostics Results window may appear if any client file that was Proforma'd met any criteria that would generate a diagnostic, such as Taxpayer is deceased. Lacerte recommends printing this diagnostic summary for your records by selecting the Print button.
Click Next to continue.
Click Print to print a summary of clients that Proforma'd on the Your Transfer Process is Complete window. (if needed)
Click Finish to close the Proforma Wizard.

Once the Proforma process is complete you can access the next tax year Lacerte program to begin the transfer.

If Lacerte is already opened, select the Client menu and choose Refresh to import your clients.
If Lacerte is closed, open Lacerte and when prompted, click Yes to transfer clients.

PTO recommends creating a copy of the original return to save the original entries.  However, printing the 1040X from the copied return will incur a new charge.  While a copy  is recommended, always print from the original return that was paid for so as to not be charged again.  


 To amend an individual's return in ProConnect Tax Online please follow these steps:



First, open the return that needs to be amended and create a PDF of the current return. 
   
Click on the File Return tab.
Click on View/Print PDF to open the PDF of the current return.
Alternatively, choose Partial Print from the left hand column and select what forms you want to generate a PDF for.
After opening the PDF of the current return click on the Save button located in the upper left corner of the screen and save the return to a location such as the My Documents folder.
 
Once a PDF has been created, close the open PDF and return to ProConnect Tax Online.
Go back to the Input Return section. (In TY2012 and prior, go to Enter Data tab).  

Select Miscellaneous Forms at the bottom of the list in the left column view.
Go to General Information and Federal (1040X)



 

TY2012 and Prior Image

 

 




Check the Box for Amending Federal Return.
If the state is being amended, put a 1 in the box in the Return(s) To Amend section.

Make an entry in the field Year to amend.  This is required to populate the state amended form.


 

TY2012 and Prior Image

 

 



Fill in any and all data applicable/needed in the Miscellaneous Information.
In the Federal Income Tax Return section, fill out the As Originally Reported column.


 

TY2012 and Prior Image

 
 
 



Once the original amounts are entered, make the changes in the tax return where appropriate.  The program will then automatically calculate the differences.
Do not use the Correct Amount [Override] column unless you're amending a prior year return in the current year program, or it is absolutely necessary.  The Correct Amount overrides will stop any program calculation.
After the Amended Return (1040X) has been filled out, review the return for accuracy by clicking on the Check Results tab, clicking on Federal Tax Forms and then viewing the 1040X.
Once the return has been reviewed, click on the File Tab and select View/Print PDF now button and print the return.


*Note: By marking the return Amended, the As Originally Reported column will not automatically show the numbers from the original return. This will need to be entered manually.

How to accept the Link invitation sent by the accountant.
My accountant has sent me an invite to Intuit Link...do I need a login for that application?
 

Solution
Anyone invited into Intuit Link will be required to have a User ID and password. 
NOTE: The taxpayer's user ID will be the email address that the Link invitation was sent to.
 

To accept a Link invitation from your accountant:


In the email received from the accountant, click the Accept button.

 

Click Continue on the Sign Up page.

 
NOTE: If the taxpayer needs to use a different email address, do not press the continue button but contact your accountant and ask them to re-send the invitation to a different email address.

The website will then check to see if the taxpayer has an Intuit account with the email address that the accountant sent the Link invitation to. 


If an online account with the email address that the Link invitation was sent to already exists, the taxpayer will be prompted to enter their password.  If the taxpayer cannot remember their password, click the I forgot my user ID or password link under the sign in button to reset the password.

 For information on how to reset your password, see article:  Reset the Password for Intuit ProConnect Link for Taxpayers

If the taxpayer does not have an Intuit online account, they will need to create an account. The email address that the accountant sent the invite to will be the taxpayer's user ID.  The taxpayer will be asked to enter their phone number and create a password.  Then click Create Account. 


Note: A 10-digit phone number is required to create an Intuit account.
 

Next, the Welcome screen will appear.  To begin sharing tax data with the accountant, click Let's Get Started.




Once you are logged in, you will see the questions and document requests that your accountant has sent to you.
To get back to the taxpayer Link login page, go to https://link.intuit.com.  We recommend bookmarking the website so you can easily access it in the future. INF27208"

Items Included on Line 11F for a Partnership K-1,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000038985_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-20+16%3A49%3A09+UTC,1,2018-04-21 22:33:42,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
What items are included on line 11F items for a Partnership K-1?

Solution Description
Line 11F - Other Income (loss) - Amounts with code F are other items of income, gain, or loss not included in boxes 1 through 10 or reported in box 11 using codes A through E.
The partnership should give description and the amount of your share for each of these items.
Report passive activity loss amounts received following the Instructions for Form 8582. However, if the box in item D is checked, report the loss following the rules for publicly traded partnerships on page 4 of the Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1.

Code F items may include the following: 


The partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain or loss attributable to the sale or exchange of qualified preferred stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). On an attached statement, show (a) the gain or loss attributable to the sale or exchange of the qualified preferred stock, (b) the date the stock was acquired by the partnership, and (c) the date the stock was sold or exchanged by the partnership. See Rev. Proc. 2008-64, 2008-47 I.R.B. 1195 for more information.
Recoveries of tax benefit items (section 111).
Gambling gains and losses subject to the limitations in section 165(d). Indicate on an attached statement whether or not the partnership is in the trade or business of gambling.
Disposition of an interest in oil, gas, geothermal, or other mineral properties. Report the following information on an attached statement to Schedule K-1: (a) Description of the property; (b) The partner's share of the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of each property (fair market value of the property for any other disposition, such as a distribution); (c) The partner's share of the partnership's adjusted basis in the property (except for oil or gas properties); and (d) Total intangible drilling costs, development costs, and mining exploration costs (section 59(e) expenditures) passed through to the partner for the property. See Regulations section 1.1254-5 for more information.
Gains from the disposition of farm recapture property (see Form 4797) and other items to which section 1252 applies.
Any income, gain, or loss to the partnership under section 751(b).
Specially allocated ordinary gain (loss).
Any gain or loss from lines 7 or 15 of Schedule D that is not portfolio income (for example, gain or loss from the disposition of nondepreciable personal property used in a trade or business).
Any cancellation of debt income previously deferred as a result of a section 108(i) election that is included in the current year. See section 108(i) for events that will cause previously deferred income to be reported, and a special rule for allocating deferred income to the partners.  Special rule for filers of Form 8865. Filers of Form 8865, Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships, cannot defer recognizing and reporting cancelled debt income on Form 8865, in accordance with the section 108(i) election, unless the foreign partnership filed a U.S. partnership return and made the election. A foreign partnership must file Form 1065 or Form 1065-B to make the section 108(i) election. These foreign partnerships also have an annual reporting requirement on Form 1065 or Form 1065-B for each tax year after the election until all items deferred under section 108(i) have been recognized. See Rev. Proc. 2009-37, 2009-36 I.R.B. 309 for details.  
Gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business (QSB) stock (as defined in the Instructions for Schedule D) that is eligible for the section 1202 exclusion. The section 1202 exclusion applies only to QSB stock held by the partnership for more than 5 years. Corporate partners are not eligible for the section 1202 exclusion. Additional limitations apply at the partner level. Report each partner's share of section 1202 gain on Schedule K-1. Each partner will determine if he or she qualifies for the section 1202 exclusion. Report on an attached statement to Schedule K-1 for each sale or exchange (a) the name of the corporation that issued the QSB stock, (b) the partner's share of the partnership's adjusted basis and sales price of the QSB stock, and (c) the dates the QSB stock was bought and sold.
Gain eligible for section 1045 rollover (replacement stock purchased by the partnership). Include only gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business (QSB) stock (as defined in the Instructions for Schedule D) that was deferred by the partnership under section 1045 and reported on Form 8949/Schedule D. See the Instructions for Schedule D and the Instructions for Form 8949 for more details. The partnership makes the election for section 1045 rollover on a timely filed (including extensions) return for the year in which the sale occurred. Corporate partners are not eligible for the section 1045 rollover. Additional limitations apply at the partner level. Each partner will determine if he or she qualifies for the rollover. Report on an attached statement to Schedule K-1 for each sale or exchange (a) the name of the corporation that issued the QSB stock, (b) the partner's share of the partnership's adjusted basis and sales price of the QSB stock, (c) the dates the QSB stock was bought and sold, (d) the partner's distributive share of gain from the sale of the QSB stock, and (e) the partner's distributive share of the gain that was deferred by the partnership under section 1045. Do not include these amounts on line 11 of Schedule K.
Gain eligible for section 1045 rollover (replacement stock not purchased by the partnership). Include only gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business (QSB) stock (as defined in the Instructions for Schedule D) the partnership held for more than 6 months but that was not deferred by the partnership under section 1045. See the Instructions for Schedule D for more details. A partner (other than a corporation) may be eligible to defer his or her distributive share of this gain under section 1045 if he or she purchases other QSB stock during the 60-day period that began on the date the QSB stock was sold by the partnership. Additional limitations apply at the partner level. Report on an attached statement to Schedule K-1 for each sale or exchange (a) the name of the corporation that issued the QSB stock, (b) the partner's share of the partnership's adjusted basis and sales price of the QSB stock, (c) the dates the QSB stock was bought and sold, and (d) the partner's distributive share of gain from the sale of the QSB stock. For more information, see Regulations section 1.1045-1. Do not include these amounts on line 11 of Schedule K.

For more information see the 1065 Schedule K-1 instructions.

FAQ for the ProConnect Tax Online (PTO) Advanced Organizer

Frequently Asked Questions


What is the Advanced Organizer?  The Advanced Organizer allows the preparer to customize requests for tax information based on prior year information.  As a result, requests sent to taxpayers only ask what is relevant for those taxpayers based on their own tax situation. Prior year tax information will be leveraged to build a list of documents to request for the upcoming tax year. Grouped tax topics can be configured to add additional questions based on life changes that could impact your client?s tax situation. 

I created a template with my questions last year.  Where did it go?  You will still have access to this in the PDF.  Select Actions from the Tax Return list. 

I've completed all of the setup for the Organizer items.  But, I'm unable to send an Invite from PTO. Currently the Data Requests and Invites from PTO are disabled.   We will be releasing more functionality in future releases. 

I need to send a document or request to my client now and can't wait. What should I do? For immediate use, go to the Intuit Link site at link.intuit.com/accountant to complete any requests. 
 I shared the return with my client, why are they not seeing it? 

If the return was shared using the Share via Link button and the client did not receive it, try saving the return as a PDF and then uploading the the document directly to the client via Link. 

Am I able to import my clients source documents right into the return?

Only 1099-INT, 1099-DIV and 1098's can utilize the review & import feature at this time. Use the steps here to import the documents HOW26001

Depreciation Schedule: Next Year and Section 179 Limitation,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000035021_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+18%3A13%3A40+UTC,0,2017-08-10 18:13:40,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
On federal and state returns, Section 179 deductions are limited if total assets placed in service exceed a set amount.  The particular amount varies by jurisdiction and year.  For the current year, Lacerte calculates all applicable limitations, and shows the limited deduction on the current year depreciation schedule.

Solution Description
The next year's depreciation schedule is an estimated projection.Since the total number of assets placed in service next year is not yet available, Lacerte does not attempt to calculate Section 179 limitations on next year's depreciation schedule. The full elected amount is shown for each asset, even if the total elected amount exceeds the maximum ever allowable for that jurisdiction.The accuracy of the estimated projection can be improved by using the ""state if different"" Section 179 elected amount for each asset placed in service ""next year"" to avoid electing more total Section 179 expense than you anticipate the state to allow.

Depreciation recapture can occur when an asset is sold for a gain. The part of the gain that is due to depreciation (recapture) is treated as ordinary income. All three of the following must be true in order for depreciation recapture to occur:

An asset was held for more than one year.
There was a gain on the sale of the asset.
Depreciation was taken on the asset.

Depreciation Recapture on Section 1245 Property:A gain on the sale or disposition of Section 1245 property is treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation allowed or allowable on the property. The amount of gain treated as ordinary income on the sale or disposition of Section 1245 property is limited to the lower of:

Depreciation and amortization allowed or allowable on the property.

OR

The gain realized on the sale or disposition.


Resolution:

When entering the sale or disposition through the Depreciation screen, the program uses the method entered to determine what type of property the asset is. The program recaptures all depreciation for section 1245 personal property based on MACRS methods (34-69, 88) and ACRS methods (30-63) entered in ""Method.""
When entering the sale or disposition through the Disposition screen the depreciation allowed entry (Code 30) should include any prior year and current year depreciation for the asset. This number will flow to Form 4797, Page 2, Line 22.

Note: The Tuition and Fees Deduction expired at the end of 2013 so Lacerte will not optimize between the Tuition and Fees Deduction and the Education Credits unless Congress extends the Tuition and Fees Deduction. See Tax Year 2014 Extender Legislation for more information. In 2013 and prior years, based on the entries made, Lacerte will optimize between the Education Credits or the Tuition and Fees Deduction.
 
*Additional Note - Force Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC): Select the box (or enter 1) to force the Lifetime Learning Credit when the student otherwise qualifies for the American Opportunity Credit.  A student qualifies for the American Opportunity Credit when:

The student was enrolled at least half-time for at least one academic period that began in the current year (or the first 3 months of the next year if the qualified expenses were paid in the current year) at an eligible educational institution in a program leading towards a post secondary degree, certificate, or other recognized post secondary educational credential, and
The student had not completed the first 4 years of post-secondary education before the current year, and
The student was not convicted, before the end of the current year, of a felony for possession or distribution of a controlled substance.

If all of the above are true based on the entries (or absence of entries) in the""AOC Disquaifiers"" input section, the program applies the American Opportunity Credit.  Selecting this box (or entering 1) forces the application of the Lifetime Learning Credit for the student. 
AOC Credit: The American Opportunity credit is up to $2,500 for qualified tuition and related expenses paid for each eligible student.  
LLC: The lifetime learning credit is 20% of qualified expenses, up to $2,000 per return and not subject to the American Opportunity credit qualifications. This credit, based on the tuition and expenses of a student, may be claimed regardless of the amount of post secondary education the student has completed and for an unlimited number of years for the same student. To claim the lifetime learning credit, the student does not need to be pursuing a degree or other recognized educational credential. The credit is available for one or more courses and the felony drug conviction rule does not apply.

Correcting and Retransmitting a Rejected Form 5500,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000031616_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+18%3A13%3A53+UTC,0,2017-08-10 18:13:53,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Description
How do I correct and retransmit a rejected 5500? 

olution Description

When a Benefit Plan (Form 5500/5500EZ) is rejected by the Department of Labor (DOL), the agency considers the plan accepted so the plan must be amended and retransmitted.
The differences between an electronically filed Benefit Plan Return and other tax returns:

Every first E-file transmission of a 5500 return is ACCEPTED by the DOL. If it rejects, and is retransmitted, it will be an AMENDED return.  In comparison: the IRS has not ACCEPTED a tax return until you receive an ACCEPTANCE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Then, and only then, is a change to a return an amendment.
The reason why the DOL strongly advises that Benefit plan submissions be amended rather than corrected and retransmitted, is that if the plan is not amended it will appear as another submission within the Form 5500 /5500-SF Filing Search at the US DOL web site http://www/portal/app/disseminate?execution=Des.
For example: If a benefit plan is submitted to the DOL and returned as rejected, the initial submission still appears in the Filing Search. This constitutes an acceptance of the benefit plan, but a stop condition which means the agency wants additional information or a particular correction to the plan. Using the steps listed above in the Lacerte program will amend this submission.
If a benefit plan is corrected and retransmitted but not marked as Amended, the DOL system sees this as a separate benefit plan submission and will appear that way in their web site search as a second benefit plan with the identical plan name and E IN. Amending the initial benefit plan will avoid confusion over which benefit plan to view and ensure that the contents of viewed benefit plan are complete and accurate.

To amend the 5500 and e-file the amended return:

Before you begin: Lacerte recommends making a copy of your original return, prior to making any amendment changes to insure the original data remains intact for future reference, this is not a requirement.

Additional information:


 


The following reference information is provided as guidelines from the Internal Revenue Service to tax professionals with regard to identity verification. 


 

Q1. Why am I being asked for my driver's license number?

A1. In an effort to better protect you from identity thieves, some states will be trying new approaches. Some states may ask for additional identification information, such as your driver's license number, when you are preparing your state tax return. This will be another layer of protection because identity thieves may already have your name and Social Security number, but perhaps not your driver's license number. States requesting this information have the ability to match driver's license information and other identifying records to help confirm your identity.
 

Q2. Do I need to enter a driver's license to file my Federal Tax return? 

A2. You do not need a driver's license number to file your Federal tax return. Some states may require this information.  The program will generate a diagnostic when the identification is required to electronically file a state return.
 
Reference:  IRS Publication 1345  sets forth the following guidelines as they relate to identify verification.  This information can be found starting on Page 23 of the document.

State Agency Driver's License and State ID Expectations


In-Person Transaction

The ERO must inspect a valid government picture identification; compare picture to applicant; and record the name, social security number, address and date of birth. Verify that the name, social security number, address, date of birth and other personal information on record are consistent with the information provided through record checks with the applicable agency or institution or through credit bureaus or similar databases.
For in-person transactions, the record checks with the applicable agency or institution or through credit bureaus or similar databases are optional. * Examples of government picture identification (ID) include a driver's license, employer ID, school ID, state ID, military ID, national ID, voter ID, visa or passport. If there is a multi-year business relationship, you should identify and authenticate the taxpayer.
*This means that obtaining a credit report is not required where identification steps have been taken.

Remote Transaction

The electronic return originator must record the name, social security number, address and date of birth. Verify that the name, social security number, address, date of birth and other personal information on record are consistent with the information provided through record checks with the applicable agency or institution or through credit bureaus or similar databases.

Theft Protection PIN

This provides an input field to enter an IRS-issued Theft Protection PIN, or IP PIN.  For more information, please refer to this IRS Frequently Asked Questions article. 
NOTE:  The 6-digit IP PIN is sometimes confused with the 5-digit e-File PIN; they're not the same or interchangeable.
 
The PIN will be applicable for the current tax year only.   Taxpayers will receive a letter and PIN each year in January for a period of 3 years following the last validated incident.  If the taxpayer misplaces or loses the letter, they will not be able to obtain a new PIN.  The return may still be filed without the PIN; however, there may be a delay in the processing of the return while the IRS validates the identity of the taxpayer.
If both the taxpayer and spouse have received a PIN, use only the PIN of the primary SSN or ITIN on the return.  If the taxpayer indicates that they did not receive the letter, the preparation or signature process should continue normally.  Electronic returns will be subject to the IRS acceptance standards without regard to the Identity Protection PIN.
 
 

 

For Tax Years 2014 and Prior

 Open the return and go to Input Return (Enter Data in TY2012 and prior)

Click and expand the General section
Click on Misc. Info/Direct Deposit

Enter the primary taxpayer's six digit Identity Protection PIN in Identity Theft Protection PIN



NOTE: In 2014 there are no inputs for a dependent IPN.

Depreciaton Method:  This entry is mandatory.  
In the respective modules, go to the Depreciation input screen.  In the grid, click on the down-arrow to choose the number from the method table that corresponds to the method of depreciation used for the asset.  
 

ACRS / MACRS methods

When you use an ACRS or MACRS method, you do not need to enter a life in ""Life or Class Life"" unless you prefer to use a different life than expressed in the table. In general, use the MACRS method for assets placed in service after December 31, 1986 and for assets for which MACRS was elected in 1986. Use the ACRS method for assets placed in service before 1987 in accordance with the IRS instructions.
Nonrecovery method
When you use a nonrecovery method, enter the life in ""Life or Class Life.""
For additional limitations on automobiles and other listed property, see ""Automobiles and Other Listed Property.""
Under GDS, most tangible property is assigned to one of eight main property classes. The following is a list of the property classes and examples of the types of property included in each class. This table provides general guidelines only. For a complete discussion on property classes and types of property please see IRS Publication 946.

 Form 5498 is an informational return. The IRS requires they be filed by companies that maintained any individual retirement arrangement (IRA), including a deemed IRA under section 408(q) in the tax year.

Get an IP PIN Tool - IRS Statement July 19 2016,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000024862_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-19+22%3A27%3A28+UTC,0,2018-04-21 22:35:56,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Description
IRS has announced that, following a temporary suspension, it has re-launched its ""Get an IP PIN"" (Identity Protection Personal Identification Number) tool on its website with a stronger authentication process to help protect taxpayers. 

Additional Information
Background. To provide relief to victims of identity theft, IRS began issuing IP PINs to eligible taxpayers in Fiscal Year 2011. An IP PIN is a 6-digit number assigned to eligible taxpayers that allows their tax returns/refunds to be processed without delay and helps prevent the misuse of their Social Security Numbers (SSNs) on fraudulent Federal income tax returns. 

  


 A taxpayer can receive an IP PIN if he meets one of the following criteria:


He received an IP PIN last year;
He received a CP01A (which provides an IP PIN) or CP01F (which invites the taxpayer to obtain an IP PIN because he had a non-tax identity theft issue) notice; or 
He filed his last tax return as a resident of Florida, Georgia or the District of Columbia (DC). 


 Taxpayers receive their IP PINs by regular mail unless they received a CPO1F or the reason they received an IP PIN was their Florida, Georgia or DC residence. 


  


 In 2015 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), IRS provided instructions for taxpayers who were assigned an IP PIN, and who lost, misplaced, or didn't receive the IP PIN in the mail. It said that such a taxpayer had to obtain his IP PIN before he could electronically file his return. He could retrieve his lost IP PIN by following the instructions at IRS's ""Get an IP PIN"" webpage. (See Weekly Alert ¶ 34 10/15/2015.) 


  


IRS temporarily suspended online program. Back in March, IRS announced that it had temporarily suspended the IP PIN tool on 
 IRS.gov and provided instructions to taxpayers affected by the suspension. (See Weekly Alert ¶ 43 03/10/2016 for more details.) 


  


Re-launched tool has heightened security features. On July 19, IRS announced that it re-launched the ""Get an IP PIN"" tool on its website, complete with a multi-factor authentication process that will help prevent automated attacks. 


  


 Taxpayers must now verify their identities using a more rigorous ""Secure Access"" process that requires them to have immediate access to an email address, account information from a credit card or from another type of loan (e.g., a car loan or a home equity line of credit), and a text-enabled mobile phone. New and returning users must follow the Secure Access steps outlined in Fact Sheet 2016-20, 06/07/2016, ""How to Register for Get Transcript Online Using New Authentication Process"". (The Get Transcript Online tool was the first to use the Secure Access process, which IRS describes in the Fact Sheet as ""in line with...the latest industry practices used by major financial institutions"".)

The ratio of non-qualified use to the period of ownership is multiplied by the gain of the sale that is otherwise eligible for the exclusion (so the gain less any post-May 6, 1997 depreciation) to determine the amount of gain allocated to non-qualified use. This portion of gain allocated to non-qualified use is not eligible for the Section 121 exclusion. For additional information, refer to IRS Publication 523 and the Sale of Home - Gain (or Loss), Exclusion, and Taxable Gain Worksheet.

First-time home buyer credit previously taken on this home (Ctrl+T):
Note: In most instances Home #1 should be selected. Home #2 should ONLY be selected when for instances where a second Form 5405 is needed ? such as when both the taxpayer and spouse claimed the credit in a year prior to being married.
For homes purchased in 2008, if the home ceases to be the taxpayer?s main home before the 15-year repayment period is expired, then all remaining annual installments must be included as additional tax. If the home is sold to someone who is not related to the taxpayer, this repayment amount is limited to the amount of gain on the sale.
For homes purchased in 2009, the credit must be repaid only if the home ceases to be the taxpayer?s main home within the 36-month period beginning on the purchase date. When the repayment applies, if the home is sold to someone who is not related to the taxpayer, the repayment amount is limited to the amount of gain on the sale.
Note: When computing the amount of credit to repay, the basis of the home must be adjusted by the amount of credit that has not been repaid. The program will automatically adjust the basis in the computation of the gain for purposes of limiting the credit recapture ? based on the gain (loss) of this sale coupled with the prior year credit entered on Screen 38.2, EIC, Residential Energy, Other Credit (Screen 39 in 2013 and prior years).

This portion of gain allocated to non-qualified use is not eligible for the Section 121 exclusion.

Any information you need to complete a disclosure statement for reportable transactions in which the partnership participates. If the partnership participates in a transaction that must be disclosed on Form 8886, Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement, both you and the partnership may be required to file Form 8886 for the transaction. The determination of whether you are required to disclose a transaction of the partnership is based on the category(s) under which the transaction qualifies for disclosure and is determined by you and the partnership. You may have to pay a penalty if you are required to file Form 8886 and do not do so. See the Instructions for Form 8886 for details.

Inversion gain. The partnership will provide a statement showing the amounts of each type of income or gain that is included in inversion gain. The partnership has included inversion gain in income elsewhere on Schedule K-1.

Also, your inversion gain (a) is not taken into account in figuring the net operating loss (NOL) for the tax year or the NOL that can be carried over to each tax year, (b) may limit your credits, and (c) is treated as income from sources within the U.S. for the foreign tax credit. See section 7874 for details.

The partnership will report your portion of the conservation reserve program payments in box 20 using code Z. See Schedule SE (Form 1040) for information on excluding the payment from your calculation of self-employment tax.  
Acceleration of AMT credit (corporations only). If a corporate partner has made an election to accelerate the AMT credit in lieu of bonus depreciation, it is required to notify the partnership in writing of this election. See Rev. Proc. 2009-16, 2009-6 I.R.B. 449 and Rev. Proc. 2009-33, 2009-29 I.R.B. 150 for more information about the written notification that the electing corporate partner must provide the partnership. The partnership is required to recompute the electing corporate partner's share of depreciation on any eligible qualified property or extension property to eliminate bonus depreciation and use the straight line depreciation method for such property. The partnership will attach a statement to Schedule K-1 that lists each partnership item that includes bonus depreciation and shows the electing corporate partner's adjustment for each item that results from the recomputed depreciation and elimination of the bonus depreciation. The partner must adjust the amount shown on Schedule K-1 for these partnership items by the amount of the corresponding adjustment. See section 168(k)(4) for more information.  
Any information you may need to comply with the limitation on excess farm losses of certain taxpayers under section 461(j).  
Any other information you may need to file your return not shown elsewhere on Schedule K-1.

Solo or Individual 401(k) / Total SE elective deferrals (except Roth) (1 = maximum):  If as a self-employed individual, the taxpayer or spouse participated in a self-employed retirement plan that allows deductible elective deferral contributions (such as an individual 401(k) plan), enter the amount of deductible elective deferral contributions made or enter numeric 1 to maximize the deductible elective deferrals based on the taxpayer's age). 
    If the Individual 401(k) plan allows for designated Roth contributions, do not enter those amounts here. 
     Instead, enter designated Roth contributions to an Individual 401(k) plan in 
   Total designated Roth contributions (1=maximum) (screen 24, codes 144 and 194). 
     If the taxpayer or spouse is age 50 or older and made catch-up contributions, include the catch-up contributions in this entry as well. 
     Amounts in excess of $16,500 are assumed to be catch-up contributions. 
     If the taxpayer has elective deferrals that are less than $16,500 but a portion of the deferral is a catch-up contribution, enter that portion in 
   Self-employed catch-up contributions included above [O] (Screen 24, codes 45 and 95). 
     The amounts entered here are used to calculate the self-employed qualified retirement plan deduction on Form 1040 and elective deferrals on Form 8880, line 2 (Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contributions).
  


Note: Enter Employer contributions to the retirement plan in the Profit-sharing, Money Purchase, or SEP input field.
  
   


Catch-up contributions included above [O]:  If the taxpayer or spouse is age 50 or older, participated in a self-employed retirement plan that allows for elective deferral contributions (such as an Individual 401(k) plan), and self-employed elective deferral contributions are entered in Total SE Elective Deferrals (Screen 24, codes 44 and 94), amounts entered in those fields in excess of $16,500 are considered catch-up contributions. 
If the total deferrals are less than $16,500 and a portion of the total deferrals are catch-up contributions, 
enter that amount here. 


Employer contributions to the retirement plan should be entered in the Profit-sharing, Money Purchase, or SEP input fields.
  
   


Total designated Roth contributions (1 = maximum):  If as a self-employed individual, the taxpayer or spouse participated in a self-employed retirement plan that allows designated Roth contributions (such as an Individual 401(k) plan), enter the amount of designated Roth contributions made (or enter numeric 1 to maximize the designated Roth contributions based on the taxpayer's age).  Do not enter deductible elective deferrals in this field.  Instead, enter deductible elective deferrals to an Individual 401(k) plan in Total SE elective deferrals (except Roth) (1 = maximum) (screen 24, codes 44 and 94).  If the taxpayer or spouse is age 50 or older and made designated Roth catch-up contributions, include the catch-up contributions in this entry as well.  The program assumes that amounts entered in this field in excess of $16,500 are catch-up contributions.  If the taxpayer has designated Roth contributions that are less than $16,500 and a portion of the designated Roth contribution is a catch-up contribution, enter the portion that is a catch-up contribution in Catch-up contributions included above [O] (Screen 24, codes 145 and 195).  The amounts entered here are not deducted on the tax return.  They are used to calculate the allowable designated Roth contributions based on income limits.  Refer to the IRS Publication 560 worksheet, which is generated with the tax return and shows the allowable amount of designated Roth contributions.   Employer contributions to the retirement plan should be entered in the Profit-sharing, Money Purchase, or SEP input fields.
  
   


Catch-up contributions included above [O]:  If the taxpayer or spouse is age 50 or older, participated in a self-employed retirement plan that allows for designated Roth contributions (such as an Individual 401(k) plan), and self-employed designated Roth contributions are entered in Total Designated Roth Contributions (1=maximum) (Screen 24, codes 144 and 194), the program assumes that amounts entered in those fields in excess of $16,500 are considered catch-up contributions.  Enter the amount of catch-up contributions included in those fields if the total deferrals are less than $16,500 and a portion of the total deferrals are catch-up contributions. 
  
  

Employer contributions to the retirement plan should be entered in the Profit?sharing, Money Purchase, or SEP input fields.
 


SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans:



Letter Use Only - Contributions/withdrawals due date [O]:  Enter the date by which the taxpayer or spouse must make contributions to (or withdrawals from) a qualified retirement plan, SEP, or SIMPLE to override the date that prints on the client letter.
     
   


Net earnings [A]:  By default, the program calculates net earnings for qualified plan, SEP, and SIMPLE purposes based on net earnings from Schedule SE, less the self-employment tax deduction. To adjust the net earnings amount for qualified plan and SEP purposes for the taxpayer or spouse, enter the amount of the adjustment. 
     An entry in this field adjusts line 1 of the SEP/Qualified Plan worksheet, or line 1 of the SIMPLE worksheet. 
     An input field is also provided in the Schedule C, Schedule F, Partnership, S Corporation, Other Income, and Contracts and Straddles input sections allowing you to exclude self-employment earnings of certain activities from the SE retirement earnings base. This field is found on Input Screen 24 Code 15.  
   Amounts entered in these input fields adjust the automatic calculation of net earnings for qualified plan and SEP purposes only.  If net earnings are negative, the program uses entries in these fields as the net earnings base (e.g., the program adds a positive entry to zero instead of adding it to the net loss).
 


SIMPLE Plans Only:
Enter SIMPLE plan contributions in Self-Employed SIMPLE (1 = maximum) (Screen 24, codes 22 and 72).  



SIMPLE - Self-employed SIMPLE (1 = maximum):  Enter an amount of SIMPLE contribution, or enter 1 to calculate the maximum SIMPLE contribution or $11,500 ($14,000 if age 50 or older). The program limits the deduction to net earnings from self-employment.  If the taxpayer or spouse has elective deferrals from a W-2, the program limits the SIMPLE contribution to the excess of the maximum elective deferral amount over the elective deferrals entered with the W-2.
 As an example, if a taxpayer under age 50 has a W-2 reflecting $8,000 in 401(k) contributions, the SIMPLE deduction (before employer matching) will be limited to $8,500 (the $16,500 maximum elective deferral base less the $8,000 contributed as an employee).

   If the taxpayer is age 50 or older, and has elective deferrals from a W-2, refer to 
   Catch-up Contributions Included on Form W-2 [O] (Screen 24, codes 46 and 96) for additional entries that may be required to maximize the SIMPLE deduction.
     
   


SIMPLE - Employer matching rate (.xxxx) [O]:  The program defaults to a 3% employer matching rate. Enter a percentage to override the automatic rate. The program multiplies the employer matching rate by net earnings from self-employment.  Enter ""
   -1"" to suppress the employer matching rate.
     
   


SIMPLE - Catch-up contributions included on Form W-2 [O]:  For all elective deferral plans entered in the W-2 screen, the program assumes that amounts in excess of $16,500 are catch-up contributions (with the exception of 408(p) plans). 
     For 408(p) plans, the program assumes that amounts in excess of $11,500 are catch-up contributions. 
     If the amount of elective deferrals entered with Form W-2 are less than $16,500 (non-408(p) plans) or $11,500 (408(p) plans), but a portion of the amount included on the W-2 is a catch-up contribution, enter the amount to override the program?s automatic calculation.
  

    
   


SIMPLE - 1 = nonelective contributions (2%):  The program defaults to employer matching contributions. Enter 1 to have the program apply a 2% non-elective contribution. The program multiplies 2% by the lesser of $245,000 or net earnings from self-employment.
     
   


SIMPLE - Self-employed SIMPLE [O]:  Enter an amount to override the self-employed SIMPLE deduction.

The following information is provided by Publication 5199 and lists steps to take to contact the IRS if tax related identity theft is suspected.
Note- If you believe you are a victim of tax identity theft through TurboTax, please contact our dedicated support line for victims of fraud 1-800-944-8596.

Detailed Information
 
An unexpected message from the IRS could be a warning sign that your Social Security number is being misused by an identity thief. Contact the IRS if you receive a notice that:

more than one tax return was filed in your name, or 
IRS records show you were paid by an employer you don't know.

 
Like many Americans, you may be filing your tax return soon. Unfortunately, tax season is when some people learn they?re a victim of identity theft. If you?re one of them, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can help you recover.

An IRS Notice Could Tip You Off About Identity Theft

There are several ways identity theft can affect the processing of your tax return. Most involve someone misusing your Social Security number (SSN), which the IRS uses to make sure your filing is accurate and complete and that you get any refund you are due.
If your SSN has been misused, you could receive an IRS notice that:

more than one tax return was filed in your name, or
IRS records show you were paid by an employer you don?t know.

If someone uses your SSN to file for a tax refund before you do, the IRS may believe you already filed and received your refund. You might not know this until you get a letter from the IRS telling you that more than one return was filed in your name.
If someone used your SSN to get a job, the employer may report that person?s income to the IRS using your SSN. This may lead the IRS to believe you did not report all of your income on your tax return. If this happens, the IRS might send you a notice that you appear to have received wages from an employer you don?t know.



Think you?re a victim of tax-related identity theft? Contact the IRS

If you get a notice from the IRS, respond immediately to the name and number printed on the notice.
If you think you have tax issues related to identity theft, let the IRS know as soon as possible, even if you don?t have any evidence that it?s affected your tax return. Visit the IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit web site or call 1-800-908-4490. The unit?s hours are 8:00 am to 8:00 pm (your local time). Specialists will work with you to get your tax return filed, get you any refund you are due, and protect your IRS account from identity thieves in the future.
You can document the identity theft by submitting a police report or the IRS ID Theft Affidavit, Form 14039. When you file the affidavit, you will have to prove your identity with a copy of a valid government-issued identification, like your Social Security card, driver?s license or passport. New! This form is now available in 2015 Lacerte (Click Here to generate and complete this form)



Other Steps to Respond to Identity Theft

In addition to contacting the IRS, it?s important to take certain steps quickly to minimize the potential damage from identity theft if your information is accidentally disclosed or deliberately stolen:

File a police report with local law enforcement officials. This is an essential step in claiming your rights.
Close any accounts opened without your permission.
Place a ""Fraud Alert"" on your credit reports, order copies, and review them carefully. Notifying one of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies that you need a fraud alert is sufficient. That company will notify the other two. 
    
Equifax: 800-525-6285 www.equifax.com 
Experian: 888-397-3742 www.experian.com 
Trans Union: 800-916-8800 www.transunion.com
 
Report the theft to the Federal Trade Commission. 
    
Online: www.ftc.gov/complaint 
By phone: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338) or TTY, 1-866-653-4261
 

You can learn more about these steps at OnGuardOnline.gov/idtheft.



Avoid Phishing Scams

Some identity thieves send emails that appear to be from the IRS to try to get you to give up your personal information. In fact, the IRS generally does not contact taxpayers by email. If you get an email that claims to be from the IRS, do not reply or click on any links. Instead, forward it to phishing@irs.gov.



Additional IRS Offices and Contacts

If you believe your tax issue can?t be handled online or by phone, you can visit an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC). Visit the TAC office locator to find a TAC office near you.
Call the IRS Tax Fraud Referral Hot Line (800-829-0433) if you suspect someone is misusing your identification information to commit tax fraud. You also may submit Form 3949A (Information Referral) to report potential tax law violations to the IRS.
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS), an independent organization within the IRS, helps taxpayers solve problems with the agency. TAS has at least one local taxpayer advocate in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. You can call your local advocate. The number is in your phone book; in Publication 1546, Taxpayer Advocate Service ? Your Voice at the IRS; and on the IRS web site at Contact Your Advocate. You can also call the IRS?s toll-free case intake line at 1-877-777-4778.

Box 2. Shows nonpatronage distributions paid to you during the year in cash, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (not including nonqualified written notices of allocation).


  


Box 3. Shows per-unit retain allocations paid to you during the year in cash, qualified per-unit retain certificates, or other property.

Why is Form 8949 not generating in 2013 or later in ProConnect Tax Online?
The purpose is to show the gain or loss on a per asset basis. This information, which used to be on the Sch D-1, it is not included by default on Form 8949 this year.
Note: The Form 8949 replaced the Schedule D-1 starting in the 2012 ProConnect Tax Online program.


  

 

Resolution
The form 8949 and instructions for Short Term and Long Term transactions have changed. Per Form 8949 instructions:
""Exception 3. Form 8949 is not required for certain transactions. You may be able to aggregate those transactions and report them directly on either line 1a (for short term transactions) or line 8a (for long-term transactions) of Schedule D. This option applies only to transactions (other than sales of collectibles) for which:

You received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) that shows basis was reported to the IRS and does not show a nondeductible wash sale loss in box 5, and
You do not need to make any adjustments to the basis or type of gain or loss (short-term or long-term) reported on Form 1099-B (or substitutes statement), or to your gain or loss.
If you choose to report these transactions directly on Schedule D, you do not need to include them on Form 8949 and do not need to attach a statement. For more information, see the Schedule D instructions. ""

 
The Form 8949 will not generate when basis is reported to the IRS, because it is not required unless there is an adjustment or when the Basis is not reported to the IRS or not on a 1099-B.Note: Even though the 8949 is not required the Schedule D will generate with the correct amount.
 
However you can force the Form 8949 by following the directions below:


INDIVIDUAL



Navigate to Income>Schedule D/4797/etc (Carryover)

Place a ""1"" in the field ""Print all assets on form 8949: 1=yes, 2=no [O]""  




FIDUCIARY



Navigate to Income>Schedule D/4797/etc (Carryover)

Place a ""1"" in the field ""Print all assets on form 8949: 1=yes, 2=no [O]""   


 
Note: This option is on a per client basis so this must be checked for every client in which you want to produce this on. This is not a required option but will help with reconciling stock transactions entered in the Schedule D/4797/etc input screen.

Generally, the state of residence offers a credit for some portion of the tax paid to the other state.Two factors may prevent the normal behavior:

Reciprocal agreements between states (reverse reciprocal agreements - nonresident states will generate a credit).
Lacerte system limitation: part-year state returns.

Reciprocal Agreements may affect this calculation in several ways:


Income not taxed at source: only the state of residence taxes the income, whichever state it was earned in. 
  
Indiana/Illinois bilateral agreement (in prior years)
Pennsylvania/New Jersey bilateral agreement
 

Reverse Reciprocal Agreement: Both states tax the income, but only the nonresident state offers a tax credit. 
  
Arizona, California, Indiana, Oregon, Virginia, District of Columbia  
 

Solution
For full-year residents, Lacerte calculates most Other State Tax Credit including the effects of most reciprocal agreements automatically when the taxpayer is a full year resident.For part-year residents, and for some complex full-year-resident returns, Screen 52, Other State Tax Credit must be manually filled out for the state which allows the credit (which may not be the state of residence).

 Educational institutions must provide Form 1098-T to each applicable student. It includes:


Student name, address, and taxpayer's identification number (TIN),
Enrollment and academic status
Qualified tuition and related expenses
Scholarships and/or grants, taxable or not.


 This form is informational only: it alerts students that they may be eligible for income tax education credits, although it does not contain all of the information needed to claim the credit.
 
The taxpayer may choose whether to claim education credits, tuition-and-fees deductions, or neither.


  


Solution Description

To claim the credit:




Input for the eduction credits (Hope and Lifetime Learning) is located in Credits, ""Education Credits / Tuition Deduction"". 
 


By default, the program will optimize between the credit or tuition deduction, and print a diagnostic indicating which option is more favorable. To override its decision, make an entry in ""Blank=Optimize, 1=force credit, 2=force tuition deduction"".
 


If the Form 1098-T is for a dependent, the Dependent Information, Dependents, should be displayed when clicking in the First Name Field, the Last Name and Social Security Number should populate.
 


If this for the Taxpayer or Spouse, enter a 1 for taxpayer or 2 for spouse in the Student Information section. 
 
Form 1098-T includes either payments received (box 1) or amounts billed (box 2). The amount in box 1 or box 2 may be different than the amount actually paid. Only enter the amounts actually paid in Current Year Expenses. 


Scholarships or Grants:


  


 There is no specific input for scholarships or grants.  However, if the scholarships or grants are non-taxable, they would reduce the amount entered in the field ""Qualified tuition and fees (net of nontaxable benefits)"".  


  





  


  


  



From Publication 970:


  If you pay qualified education expenses with certain tax-free funds, you cannot claim a credit for those amounts. You must reduce the qualified education expenses by the amount of any tax-free educational assistance and refund(s) you received.
 

   
 

  Tax-free educational assistance includes:
 

The tax-free parts of scholarships and fellowships.


  A scholarship or fellowship is tax free only if:
 

You are a candidate for a degree at an eligible educational institution, and
You use the scholarship or fellowship to pay qualified education expenses.

What is special depreciation allowance (SDA) and how is it entered?

Solution Description

What is special depreciation and how is it calculated:


  


 Special depreciation is 50% of the adjusted basis of the property. The program expenses the depreciated assets in this order:
  


Basis reduced by ownership percentage
Less Section 179 expense
Special 50% depreciation
Regular depreciation  

Intuit ProConnect Tax Online (PTO) automatically calculates the additional first year depreciation for qualified assets.  Your property is qualified if it is one ofthe following:

Qualified reuse and recycling property
Qualified second generation biofuel plant property
Certain qualified property acquired after December 31, 2007
Detailed information can be found here, Publication 946:  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf  The special 50% depreciation is for original use property that commences with the taxpayer. A special rule precludes the deduction for property required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of MACRS or listed property that is not used more than 50% for business.   

Special Depreciation State Considerations: 
The program automatically calculates states that do not follow Federal special depreciation. To override the state special deprecation, enter an amount or -1 for none, in Current Special Depreciation (State Column). For states with prior special depreciation, enter an amount, or -1 for none, in Prior Special Depreciation Allowance (State Column). 


Solution #1- To include an asset not included by default:
 
For example, you can include New York Liberty Zone real property located within a specific area of New York City, if it is being repaired or replaced due to the September 11, 2001 attack, or certain software depreciated using the straight-line method.

Backing Up Client Files in the Lacerte Tax Program,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000038306_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+20%3A43%3A30+UTC,0,2017-08-10 20:43:30,Last Modified 253 days ago,"How do I backup client files in the Lacerte Tax Program?

Solution:
The best way to ensure the protection of client data is to create backups on a regular basis. You can use the Lacerte Backup and Restore functions when transferring client files between computers and between subdirectories on one computer. However, you may also perform your normal system backup procedures (tape backup, etc.) to protect against system crashes.

Tips for Backing up Data





Tips for backing up data: 


       
     

Q1 How often should I backup my data?


       
     

      As a general rule, the interval for backing up data should be less than the period of work that you can afford to lose. For example, if losing one week of work would jeopardize your operations, then your interval for backups should be less than one week.
     

       
     

      It is also a good idea to keep several previous backups for a period of time and not overwrite them with the most recent backup. By retaining previous backups, you will be able to go back to an earlier version if a problem is discovered with client data and your most recent backup also contains the same problem. One of the previous versions might contain a copy of the data before the data corruption occurred. The amount of disk space used by such backups is insignificant when compared to the capacity of most modern hard drives.
     

       
     

Q2 What files need to be backed up?
 
     

       
     

      All files and subdirectories in the respective data path for each program (i.e. the Idata, Cdata, Pdata, Sdata, Rdata, etc) should be backed up regularly. The ?system file path? should be backed up as well. If anything were to happen to the program, this will save the time of reconfiguring user options, client letters, etc. 
     

       
     

      For more information on the 
      Lacerte Data File Structure, 
      click here.
     

       
     

Q3 Can I backup (burn) my data to CD or DVD?
 
     

       
     

      You cannot burn data directly to a CD from within the Lacerte Tax program. However, the CD writing software that you normally use may also be used to copy your data directories and system file path to a writable CD.  For information on how to burn your data to CD or DVD, 
      Click here.
     

       
     

Q4 Can I use an external drive or thumb drive?
 
     

       
     

      Yes. Using a removable, external drive allows you to store the backup drive in a location separate from the PC so that, in the event of a fire or theft, the data remains secure. It is generally not recommended to use a flash or ?Jump? drive for long term storage. Due to their size and functionality, they are more easily damaged or lost than other data storage media. For external drives, a USB 2.0 or Firewire-based drive is optimal. USB 1.0 drives are much slower and will take considerably longer to transfer data.  For information on how to backup your data to a Thumb Drive, 
      Click Here.
     

       
     

Q5 Can I backup to a network drive?


       
     

      Yes, but you need to have a network license to be able to backup to a networked drive.  Non-network licenses users can only backup to a local drive.
     

       
     

Q6 Does Intuit keep an off-site backup of my data?


       
     

      No, Intuit does not keep any off-site backup of your Lacerte data.  You are responsible for maintaining a backup of any files you wish to protect.
     



     
   



  To backup your clients in Lacerte Tax: 
 

Click on the Clients tab (to view the list of your clients).

Select the Clients to backup.    
Click on Client.
Click on Backup. 
Type the data path for the back up or click Browse to find an existing directory.    The destination can be a local hard drive, removable drive (i.e. USB flash drive), or a network drive. (Note- The drive letter of an external drive can change on different computers.)  NOTE:  To backup to a network drive you need a Network License.  If you do not have a network license you cannot backup clients or program options from a networked source.  
Click OK to begin the backup.



  


NOTE: If the client already exists in the destination directory, the program asks you if you want to replace the existing client with the one being backed up. Click either 
 Yes or 
 Yes to All to replace the client or group of clients, click 
 No to keep the original client and cancel backing up the client, or click 
 Cancel.

How to Expense and Amortize Start-up Costs and/or Organizational Expenditures,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000035635_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+20%3A43%3A31+UTC,1,2017-08-10 20:43:31,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
How do you expense a portion of Business Startup Costs and amortize the balance over 180 months?
 

Solution Description

 Start-up costs and/or organizational expenditures are typically capitalized or amortized over 5 years. 
   However, for costs incurred after 10/22/2004 up to $5,000 of these expenses are eligible to be expensed as a deduction. 
   The remainder is amortized over 15 years. 
   This deduction is phased out dollar for dollar for costs over $50,000. 
   Enter the amount of these expenses that are being treated as a deduction. 
   Proconnect Tax Online (PTO) will create a deduction on the appropriate form or schedule for this amount.


  


Special rule for 2010 start-up costs. For tax years beginning in 2010, you can elect to deduct up to $10,000 of business start-up costs paid or incurred after 2009. The $10,000 deduction is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount such start-up costs exceed $60,000. Any remaining costs must be amortized.


  


 The steps to expense a portion of Business Startup Costs and amortize the balance over desired months/years:


On the Input Return workspace (Enter Data in TY2012 and prior), select Deductions, then Depreciation (4562)

Enter a description for the amortization expense under Description of property

For the Form, click the drop down menu and select the activity that relates to the amortization expense
In Category select 8 = Amortization

For Date Placed in Service, enter the date in m/d/y format that the amortizable expense occurred
For Cost or Basis, enter the amortizable amount
In Method, select the Straight Line method
Then click on Detail to expand out the input area.
Scroll down to Life or class life (recovery period automatic),  and enter the desired life in years.
Under Amortization code section, select the applicable code from the drop down options:






     Select 
     Sec. 195 for Business Start-Up Expenditures
     


     Select 
      Sec. 709 for Organizational Expenditures
     
 

     10.  In the Regular Depreciation area, for Basis Reduction (amortizable costs expensed, ITC, etc.) enter an amount up to $5,000 (for costs paid or incurred before 1/1/2010) or $10000 (costs paid or incurred after 2009) for first year Start Up Costs.  This will be the actual expensed amount.

  


  


 This applies to the following Tax Types:




   Individual
   


   Partnership
   


   S-Corporate
   


   Corporate
   


   Fiduciary
   


   Exempt Organization
   


 Please note: Following the steps above allows most State returns in the affected Tax Return Types to include the deduction in their calculations.  If direct entry is desired for the Federal return, enter the amount of  Start-up costs and/or Organizational expenditures in the override fields provided in the following modules and screens:


Individual - Business Income (Schedule C),(Start-up costs only), Farm Income (Schedule F / Form 4835),(Start-up costs only)
Partnership - Deductions
Corporation - Deductions
S-Corporation - Deductions
Fiduciary - Business Income (Schedule C)(Start-up costs only), Farm (Schedule F)(Start-up costs only)

Utilizations (enter year and amount) - For any year in which there was an NOL, enter the amount of the NOL that has been ""absorbed"" (offset by income in some other year). Enter the absorption year in the description field (formatted as 2003 or 12/31/03). The Intuit Tax Online application subtracts the total utilizations from the original NOL to calculate the NOL available as a deduction in the current year.
    Example:  There was an NOL in 2012 of $50000.   In 2013, $20000 of that NOL was absorbed.  In the input screen, in the line for 2012, enter $50000 in the Net Operating Loss field.   Under Utilizations on that same line for 2012, enter 2013 in the Description field. and $20000 in the Amount field. 


 

Net Operating Loss Carryback


Note: NOL carrybacks are utilized for amended returns only.
 


 NOL carrybacks are also input based on the year the loss occurred but entered into the return that is being amended and has 2 columns for input, one for 
 Regular Losses and a separate input for 
 Consolidated, if different amounts.




Regular Net Operating Loss - If the corporation sustained a net operating loss that it is carrying back and there is an unabsorbed portion remaining in 2007, enter the net operating loss in full.
   


Utilizations - If the corporation sustained a net operating loss, and used any portion of the NOL as a deduction prior to current year, enter the individual amounts and years the corresponding NOL was used. 
    Enter the year in the description field in YYYY or M/D/Y format. 
    The program subtracts the total of these entries from the entry in the corresponding ""Regular Net Operating Loss"" to arrive at the NOL available as a deduction.
   

Elections

 As far back as Tax Year 1997 a separate election statement to forego the carryback of an NOL has not been needed.  The election is claimed on Schedule K, line 11. To make this election and ensure the NOL is carried forward to next year's program, check the 
 Forego carryback of 20YY NOL.  (20YY= Current Year).  To carry over the NOL without making the election, check 
 Carry forward 20YY NOL.  Do not use both.


  

Alternative Minimum Tax Net Operating Loss (ATNOL)

 If a corporation is subject to AMT, NOL for AMT purposes must be entered separately (on the 
 AMT NOL Deduction data section). In the first year that a corporation is subject to AMT, simply copy the prior year NOL information from the ""Regular NOL"" to the ""ATNOL"" input screen.

We understand the importance of a smooth transition, starting with the conversion of your current client files into the Intuit ProConnect Lacerte Tax software. Our comprehensive and highly rated client data conversion service is included as part of your Fast Path subscription. 
Go to the Data Conversion web site to find out if your data can be converted, how to submit your data for conversion, and how to track your converted data.

Common Questions

Q1:  When can I send in clients for conversion to Lacerte?

Data can be converted year-round, however Lacerte will begin the tax data conversion season for the prior tax year with the first release of the next year tax program, typically released in November of each year. For example we will begin converting data from 2015 tax software when 2016 Lacerte is released.
 


Q2:  How long will it take to convert my client files to Lacerte?

Our Tax Data Conversion program provides you the ability to upload and download client files with a quick turnaround for your data. Generally, it takes 4 - 7 business days to complete the conversion process. For larger blocks of data (500+ client files) or during peak season, please allow up to 10 business days for your conversion to be completed.
 


Q3:  What data converts during the conversion process?

Only pertinent data to next years tax return. The Data Conversion process will move selected items from your current tax preparation software to your new Lacerte program and is designed to be a starting point client file for preparation of next year?s tax returns. Refer to the appropriate PDF on the Data Conversion website to view the details of items that convert.
 


Q4:  My converted client files are not identical to the original files I submitted.  Why?

The Data Conversion process will move selected items from your current tax preparation software to your new Lacerte program and is not intended to convert all of your tax data, nor will it allow you to generate a tax return for the purpose of side-by-side comparison with the last year's return.  The converted files are designed to be a starting point client file to be Proforma'd to the next year's tax program.
 


Q5:  Why were some of my files not converted?

First, verify we convert the type of return in question.  Refer to the Converted Items list in Step 1 on the Data Conversion website for details of the tax types converted. It is also possible that the client data files received are either corrupt, improperly backed up, missing critical data, or password protected/locked.  Additionally, verify the affected files are viable and can be accessed in the prior tax preparation software and then make any necessary corrections before backing up the files again and re-submitting them for conversion.  If re-submitting the files, only send the affected files that have not been converted.
 


Q6:   Where can I find conversion materials?

Please view the Data Conversion website for information on items that convert, submitting and receiving conversion data files and restoring the converted files into the Lacerte Tax program.
 


Q7:  How do I back my current client files up, for conversion?

The client files should always be backed up using the current tax program from which the data is to be converted.  The client data files should NOT be copied from the data directory using Windows Explorer.  You MUST follow the backup instructions that is detailed in Step 2: on the  Data Conversion website.

Form 2848 - Taxpayer Name & Social Security Number Does Not Print - Generate,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000037766_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+20%3A43%3A38+UTC,0,2017-08-10 20:43:38,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
Form 2848 does not print the taxpayers name or the social security number when the taxpayer is deceased.

Solution Description

 This is functioning as designed. When the return is MFJ, we leave the deceased taxpayers name off the form. (Since they obviously can't comply with the signing requirement).
 
In the case of a single filer, the program assumes the executor of the estate is filing the return. When the executor is filing form 2848, the executor signs their name. (See 2848 instructions, under the paragraph that starts out ""FORM 56"")


  


 However, the problem arises that if no SSN is shown on the form, how could the IRS or the taxpayer know who this power of attorney is for? Answer: 
 Publication 559 specifically indicates that Form 2848 is not accepted as evidence of personal representation.  You need to have a will. File Form 56 or have the estate or trust file a Form 2848, using the EIN assigned to the estate or trust.


  


 Take out the date of death and print the form from the Forms Tab as a single form.

Depreciation Recapture - Section 1250,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000029831_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-20+23%3A11%3A19+UTC,0,2018-04-21 22:39:28,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Description
Depreciation Recapture on Section 1250 Property:Part or all of the gain on the sale or other disposition of Section 1250 property may be treated as ordinary income. For Section 1250 property held more than one year, the amount of gain generally treated as ordinary income is the lower of the following:1. The applicable percentage times the portion of the additional depreciation attributed to periods after 1975.OR2. The applicable percentage times the total gain.The applicable percentage used depends on whether the real property being sold or disposed is nonresidential real property, residential rental property, or low-income housing property. The date placed in service of these properties will determine the percentage that needs to be used. See IRS Publication 544 page 28 for the appropriate percentages. If Section 1250 property is held longer than one year, the additional depreciation is the excess of actual depreciation over the depreciation figured using the straight-line method. If the property is held for one year or less, all the depreciation taken is additional depreciation. There is no additional depreciation or depreciation recapture if a straight-line method is used.

Resolution:
1. When entering the sale or disposition in the Depreciation screen, the program uses the method entered to determine what type of property the asset is.The program does not recapture depreciation for section 1250 real property (methods 85 and 87) or straight-line methods (71, 81, 89, and 83). For ACRS accelerated real property methods (70, 80, and 82), the program recaptures the excess of accelerated depreciation over straight-line.2. When entering the sale or disposition in the Income section in the screen, Schedule D/4797/etc., (Dispositions for business returns), the Depreciation Allowed entry should include any prior year and current year depreciation for the asset. This number will flow to Form 4797 Page 2 Line 22. Also, the depreciation recapture entry must be entered if the property is any type of property other than Section 1245. To correspond with this depreciation recapture entry there must also be a property type entry. The property type entry will take the depreciation recapture entry and place it on the appropriate line (26a, 27a, 28a, or 29a) of Form 4797 Page 2. GEN88001"

IDAHO


Does the state provide for an automatic six month extension of time to file?  YES, if certain conditions have been met:

By the April 15th deadline, have paid either:

100 percent of taxes paid in the previous tax year OR

80 percent of current year tax liability.

If either condition a or b is met, the state will not assess a late filing penalty, but interest will be charged on any additional tax due until the amount is paid in full. For Idaho, a valid extension of time to file is based upon satisfying condition a or b, not upon the filing of a written request, which is the reason why there is not a separate state extension form.  The Idaho Form 51 Estimated Payment of Idaho Individual Income Tax is recognized by the state as being used to satisfy the above conditions if additional tax is owed beyond what was already paid or withheld. 
By qualifying for the extension, the taxpayer has until October 15th to file the return and any additional payment due.

Verify the user has full rights/permissions to the destination data path folder \?data.
Sometimes backup media can get damaged (scratches, bad sectors on the disk, and so on). If you're restoring a backup to a new computer and the old computer is still available, try using a new CD, zip disk, or USB flash drive to make another backup.
If your backup is on different media, such as a USB flash (thumb) drive or external hard drive, try copying the backup file from that media to your desktop. Then try to restore by browsing to the file location on your hard drive.
If the backup CD or other backup media is damaged and the file won't copy, or if you continue to experience other problems restoring the file, do not run SCAN DISK or any other disk-repair utility.
If you can't restore a backup at all, including older backups, contact Technical Support for assistance.

Schedule A Line 5 Income Taxes or General Sales Taxes is Blank or Less than Expected,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000029809_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-20+19%3A08%3A59+UTC,0,2018-04-21 22:39:59,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
Line 5 of the Schedule A is blank or less than expected when the return is calculated.

Solution Description


  Line 5 of the Schedule A uses the state tax rate tables to calculate the general sales tax rate for optimization purposes.  If there is no state specified in the 
  Client Information screen, in the box labeled 
  Resident State as of 12/31? then the program will not fill out line 5 of the Schedule A even when using the Income Tax method.
 

   
 

  Select a state in the screen,  
  Client Information in the box labeled  
  Resident State as of 12/31? to allow the program to calculate the tax rate.
 


  


 Another possibility is that the 4th quarter estimates are not being included in the line. The default date of 01/15/xx can not be used to have the payments be deductible in the current year.

Beginning in Tax Year 2013, the IRS has added Form 8949 to the 1041 form series. In TY12, the IRS added Form 8949 to the 1065, 1120 and 1120S form series. The codes generate in column f instead of column b (this was a change in the 2012 instructions).*Note- The codes have been revised for TY2015 per the 8949 Form Instructions and 1099-B changes.

Complete List of Codes and Instructions




IF
THEN enter this code in Column (f)
AND...


You received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) and the basis show in box 1e is incorrect....
B


If this transaction is reported on a Part I with box B checked at the top or if this transaction is reported on a Part II with box E checked at the top, enter the correct basis in column (e), and enter -0- in column (g).


If this transaction is reported on a Part I with box A checked at the top or if this transaction is reported on a Part II with box D checked at the top, enter the basis shown on Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) in column (e), even though that basis is incorrect. Correct the error by entering an adjustment in column (g). To figure the adjustment needed, see the Worksheet for Basis Adjustments in Column (g). Also see Example 4?adjustment for incorrect basis in the instructions for column (h).
 


You received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) and the type of gain or loss (short or long term) shown in box 2 is incorrect.....
T
Enter -0- in column (g). Report the gain or loss on the correct Part of Form 8949.


You received a Form 1099-B or 1099-S (or substitute statement) as a nominee for the actual owner of the property.....
N
 Report the transaction on Form 8949 as you would if you were the actual owner, but also enter any resulting gain as a negative adjustment (in parentheses) in column (g) or any resulting loss as a positive adjustment in column (g). As a result of this adjustment, the amount in column (h) should be zero. However, if you received capital gain distributions as a nominee, report them instead as described under Capital Gain Distributions in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). 


You sold or exchanged your main home at a gain, must report the sale or exchange on Part II of Form 8949 (as explained in Sale of Your Home in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040)), and can exclude some or all of the gain.....
H
Report the sale or exchange on Form 8949 as you would if you were not taking the exclusion. Then enter the amount of excluded (nontaxable) gain as a negative number (in parenthesis) in column (g). See the example in the instructions for column (g).


You received a Form 1099-B showing accrued market discount in box 1g.....
D
 Use the Worksheet for Accrued Market Discount Adjustment in Column (g), later, to figure the amount to enter in column (g). However:

If you received a partial payment of principal on a bond, don't use the worksheet. Instead, enter the smaller of the accrued market discount or your proceeds in column (g). Also report it as interest on your tax return.
If you chose to include market discount in income currently, enter -0- in column (g). Before figuring your gain or loss, increase your basis in the bond by the market discount you have included in income for all years. See the instructions for code B above. If the disposition of a market discount bond results in a loss subject to the wash sale rules, enter only ""W"" in column (f) and enter only the disallowed wash sale loss in column (g).
 


You sold or exchanged qualified small business stock and can exclude part of the gain.....
Q
Report the sale or exchange on Form 8949 as you would if you were not taking the exclusion and enter the amount of the exclusion as a negative number (in parenthesis) in column (g). However, if the transaction is reported as an installment sale, see Gain from an Installment sale of QSB stock in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).

X
Report the sale or exchange on Form 8949 as you would if you were not taking the exclusion. Then enter the amount of the exclusion as a negative number (in parenthesis) in column (g),

You have a nondeductible loss from a wash sale......
W
Report the sale or exchange on Form 8949 and enter the amount of the nondeductible loss as a positive number in column (g). See the Schedule D instructions for more information about wash sales. If you received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) and the amount of the nondeductible wash sale loss shown (box 5 of Form 1099-B) is incorrect, enter the correct amount in column (g). If the amount of the nondeductible loss is less than the amount shown on Form 1099-B (or substitute statement), attach a statement explaining the difference. If no part of the loss is a nondeductible loss from a wash sale transaction, enter -0- in column (g).


You have a nondeductible loss other than a loss indicated by code W.....
L
Report the sale or exchange on Form 8949 and enter the amount of nondeductible loss as a positive number in column (g). See Nondeductible Losses in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).


You received a Form 1099-B or 1099-S (or substitute statement) for a transaction and there are selling expenses or option premiums that are not reflected on the form or statement by an adjustment to either the proceeds or basis shown.....
E
Enter in column (d) the proceeds shown on the form or statement you received. Enter in column (e) any cost or basis shown on Form 1099-B (or substitute statement).

You disposed of collectible (see the Schedule D instructions).......
C
Enter -0- in column (g). Report the disposition on Form 8949 as you would report any sale or exchange.


You report multiple transactions on a single row as described in Exception 2  or Special provision for certain corporations, partnerships, securities dealers, and other qualified entities under Exceptions to reporting each transaction on a separate row......
M
See Exception 2 and Special provision for certain corporations, partnerships, securities dealers, and other qualified entities under Exceptions to reporting each transaction on a separate row. Enter -0- in column (g) unless an adjustment is required because of another code.


You have an adjustment not explained earlier in this column

 Foreign tax credit or deduction



  ""You cannot take a credit or deduction for foreign income taxes paid or accrued on income that is excluded under either of the exclusions. If all of your foreign earned income is excluded, you cannot claim a credit or deduction for the foreign taxes paid or accrued on that income.""

Program calculates the columns from left to right. Column (A) plus or minus columns (B) and (C) equal column (D)
If column (A) or column (D) is grayed out then that amount is considered to be zero
Most inputs on the M-3 screen are direct inputs any field that is indicated as an override will flow over automatically (i.e.: Meals and Entertainment, Depreciation)

Tax Year 2013 and prior years-

Columns (A) and (D) are not required in the first tax year an entity files the M-3

*Notes-

The Schedule M-3, Form 8916-A and the Additional Information for Schedule M-3 Filers are direct input/output screens. Almost every value needs to be entered manually. Any field that is indicated as an override field [Override] will override the automatic calculation by the program. (Example: Depreciation, Travel and Entertainment)
If you use the override fields you have to override each column. For instance, you cannot override only column A, you would also need to override columns A, C and D so the calculation foots.

Individual Roth IRA Distribution is showing as Taxable on Form 1040,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000030033_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-15+20%3A59%3A20+UTC,0,2018-04-21 22:40:38,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
A Roth IRA Distribution has been entered in the Income -> Pensions, IRAs (1099-R) input screen.  It shows as taxable on page 1 of Form 1040, but is not taxable.  How do I show as nontaxable ?

Solution Description

 If an amount is entered under 
 Taxable Amount in the 
  Income ->
Pensions, 
 IRAs (1099-R) screen,  the program treats the distribution as a nonqualified distribution by default.  These amounts flow to Form 8606, page 2, Section III, line 1.    The only amounts that should be taxable are earnings in excess of basis.  Basis amounts are not taxable since these amounts have already been taxed.  The basis in the Roth IRA will appear on line 22 of the Form 8606.


  


 To enter Roth IRA Basis and show this amount as nontaxable 
 : 


Go to Input Return workspace. (Enter Data in TY2012 and prior)  

Click on Deductions to expand that section.
Select the Adjustments to Income input screen.
Scroll to the section titled Roth IRA.

Enter the basis amount in Basis in Roth IRA contributions as of 12/31/XX

Make any other adjustments as needed

This amount flows to Form 8606, Page 2, Section III, line 22 to adjust the amount of the nonqualified deduction that should be taxed.
 
If the Roth IRA distribution is a Qualified Distribution, then no amounts should be entered under Taxable Amount in the Pensions, IRAs (1099-R) screen.

How do I create the Statement of Insolvency in the program to support the Form 982, Part I, Line 1b?From the form instructions:
Check the box on line 1b if the discharge of indebtedness occurred while you were insolvent. You are insolvent to the extent that your liabilities exceeded the fair market value (FMV) of your assets immediately before the discharge.  For details and a worksheet to help calculate insolvency, see Pub 4681. 

Resolution:
The program does not create a insolvency worksheet or statement to support the Form 982, Part I, Line 1b.

You can then attach the PDF statement to the return for e-filing by going to the General section and then to the screen, e-file PDF/Miscellaneous.Publication 4681, page 8 has an insolvency worksheet that can be used as a guideline for the input on the statement.

Solution
To export Client Data to a CSV or Standard Data format:
 


Note:

  When naming the export file it uses windows file naming structure.

Highlight the client(s) to export.
Click on Client.
Click on Export.
Select Export to file.
Click on Browse to select a different directory or leave the default directory (C:\LACERTE\??TAX\IDATA\EXPORT). (??=Tax Year)
Enter a file name or leave the default file name (EXPORT) .
Select the Export Type as Comma Delimited.
Check the box, Print Summary File to create and print summary information about the exported file.



 


Click on the plus sign (+) next to the category under the Available section.
Click on the items you would like to export.
Double click on the item or click on the (>) button to move the item to the Display section. 
  
To remove an item from the Display section, highlight it and click (<).
To change the order the program writes the items to the file, select an item in the Display section, and click the up or down button to arrange it in the list.
 
Click on OK to create the file.
Click on Exit to close the Export Client window after the file is created.
Browse to the directory where the file was saved to (Default is C:\LACERTE\??TAX\IDATA\EXPORT ??=Tax Year)

Double-click on the *.csv file to view the exported information in your default spreadsheet program. In this case, the name of the file is Export.csv.

   Neither 
   Lacerte nor

If incorrect routing and accounting information has been input in error, the Internal Revenue Service or the appropriate taxing authority must be contacted.


Once the IRS e-file return is accepted, information pertaining to the payment, such as the account information, payment date or amount, cannot be changed.  If changes are needed, the only option is to cancel the payment transaction and choose another payment method.


Taxpayers should call the Treasury Financial Agent, Customer Service, at 1-888-353-4537, toll-free, to cancel a payment or to report problems such as bank closures, lost or stolen bank account numbers, closed bank accounts or unauthorized transactions.  Customer Service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Taxpayers may also call 1-888-353-4537 to inquire about payments but should wait at least 7 - 10 days after the e-file return is accepted before calling.   
Taxpayers will be notified if a payment is returned by the financial institution due to insufficient funds, incorrect account information, closed accounts, etc. If this occurs, the IRS will send a notification letter to the address on record explaining why the payment could not be processed. The letter will provide alternative options for making the payment.  For questions regarding the letter, please call 1-888-353-4537.   
In the event the financial institution is unable to process the transaction, the taxpayer will be responsible for the tax payment and for any penalties and interest incurred.   
Contact the IRS immediately at 1-800-829-1040 if there is an error in the amount withdrawn.   
In the event Treasury causes an incorrect amount of funds to be withdrawn from a bank account, Treasury is responsible for returning any improperly transferred funds.

Topic 601 (
http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc601.html)


  


  


 You may qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, if you worked last year, but did not earn a lot of money.

EITC is a refundable tax credit meaning you could qualify for a tax refund even if you did not have federal income tax withheld.

To qualify for the credit, you must:


Have a valid Social Security Number (if you are filing a joint return, your spouse also must have a valid Social Security Number)
Have earned income from employment or from self-employment
Have a filing status other than married, filing separately
Be a U.S. citizen or resident alien all year, or a nonresident alien married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien and filing a joint return
Not have investment income over a certain amount
Not be a qualifying child of another person (if you are filing a joint return, your spouse also can not be a qualifying person)
Not file Form 2555 or 2555-EZ (related to foreign earned income), and
Have a qualifying child OR: 
  
be age 25 but under 65 at the end of the year
live in the United States for more than half the year, and
not qualify as a dependent of another person
 

If you qualify, the amount of your EITC will depend on whether you have children, the number of children you have, and the amount of your wages and income last year.

 For more information or to see if you qualify, go to 
 www.irs.gov/eitc or call 1-800-829-3676 and request 
 Publication 596, 
 Earned Income Credit.
 

Additional Questions:


Do you have earned income?

To claim the earned income credit, you must have earned income. For the year you are filing, earned income includes all income from employment, but only if it is includable in gross income. Examples of earned income are wages, salaries, tips, and other taxable employee compensation. Earned income also includes net earnings from self-employment. Earned income does not include amounts such as pensions and annuities, welfare benefits, unemployment compensation, worker's compensation benefits, or social security benefits. For tax years after 2003, members of the military who receive excludable combat zone compensation may elect to include it in earned income.
 

Do you have investment income?

If you have investment income of more than the limit allowed for the taxable year, you may not claim the EIC. Investment income includes taxable interest, tax exempt interest, dividend income, capital gain net income, certain income from rents or royalties, and certain income from passive activities. It does not include gains from selling business assets. For more information, refer to Chapter 1 Rules for everyone, in Publication 596, Earned Income Credit.
 

What is your filing status?

To claim the EIC, your filing status must be single, head of household, qualifying widow or widower, or married filing jointly. You cannot claim the EIC if your filing status is married filing separately.
 

Do you (and your spouse, if filing jointly) have a social security number?

You (and your spouse, if filing jointly) must each have a valid social security number issued by the Social Security Administration. Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC must also have a valid SSN. You cannot claim the EIC if you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) have a social security card that says ""not valid for employment"" and the number was issued so that the cardholder could receive a federally funded benefit, such as Medicaid. If you fail to provide a social security number for yourself (and your spouse, if filing jointly), the EIC will not be allowed.
 

Are you a qualifying child of another person?

If you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) are a qualifying child of another person, you cannot claim the EIC.
 

Do you have foreign earned income?

If you file Form 2555 (PDF), Foreign Earned Income, or Form 2555EZ (PDF), Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, you cannot claim the EIC.
 

Are you a nonresident alien?

If you are a nonresident alien, you can claim the EIC only if you are married to a United States citizen or resident, and you file a joint return and are taxed as a resident for the entire taxable year.
 

If you have a child, is your child a qualifying child?

To claim the EIC with a qualifying child, you must have one or more qualifying children. A qualifying child is a child who meets certain relationship, residency, and age requirements. To meet the relationship test, the child must be your:
 
* Son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, or a descendant of any of them,
 * Brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them, or
 * Eligible foster child (a child placed with you by an authorized placement agency).
  


 An adopted child (or a child placed with you for adoption by an authorized placement agency) is treated as a biological child.
 
To meet the residency test, the child must have lived with you in the United States for more than half the tax year. Military personnel stationed outside the United States on extended active duty are considered to live in the United States during that period for EIC purposes.
 
To meet the age test, the child must be under age 19 at the end of the taxable year, or under age 24 at the end of the taxable year and a full-time student during any part of any 5 months during the taxable year, or any age if permanently and totally disabled. Refer to Chapter 2, Rules if you have a qualifying child, in Publication 596 for exceptions to the time your child must have lived with you.
 

Does your child have a social security number?

Your qualifying child must have a valid social security number issued by the Social Security Administration. If your qualifying child does not have a social security number or if your child's social security card reads ""not valid for employment"" and the number was issued solely so that the child could receive a federally funded benefit, such as Medicaid, you cannot claim the EIC on the basis of that qualifying child. More information on social security numbers for purposes of the EIC can be found in Chapter 2, Rules if you have a qualifying child, of Publication 596.
 

Is your child the qualifying child of another taxpayer?

For tax years 2002 and later, if two or more persons have the same qualifying child, they can choose which one will claim the credit using that child. If more than one actually claims the credit using the same qualifying child, only one will be entitled to claim the credit using that child, as follows:
 
* The parents, if they file a joint return,
 * The parent, if only one of the persons is the child's parent,
 * The parent with whom the child lived the longest during the tax year, if two of the persons are parents of the child,
 * The parent with the highest AGI if the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time during the tax year, or
 * The person with the highest AGI, if none of the persons is the child's parent.
 

What if you do not have a qualifying child?

To claim the EIC without a qualifying child, you must meet three additional requirements: age, dependency, and residency. To meet the age test, you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) must be at least age 25, but under age 65 at the end of the taxable year. You meet the dependency test if no one else can claim you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) as a dependent on their return. If someone else can claim you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) as a dependent, but does not, you still cannot claim the EIC. To meet the residency test, you (and your spouse, if filing jointly) must live in the United States for more than half the year. Military personnel stationed outside the United States on extended active duty are considered to live in the United States during that period for EIC purposes.
 

Do you meet the Earned Income and AGI Limit?

To claim the EIC, both your earned income and adjusted gross income must be less than the limit for the number of qualifying children, for the year you are claiming the credit. You can find these limits in Publication 596.
 

How do you figure the EIC?

You must use Worksheet A or Worksheet B in the Form 1040 Instructions, Form 1040A Instructions, or Form 1040EZ Instructions to figure this credit, or the IRS can figure the credit for you. If you want the IRS to figure the credit, carefully follow the steps in the instructions for your tax return or refer to Publication 596. This publication is also a valuable source for information on the earned income credit in general. If you file your return electronically, the credit will be figured for you. For more information about filing electronically, see e-file at the bottom of the IRS.gov homepage.
 

What is advance EIC?

If you expect to qualify for the EIC in the current year, you may be able to receive part of it in advance during the year. To see if you qualify to receive advance EIC, refer to Topic 604.

How to adjust the java engine by editing the Jx.Config-Template file.
Lacerte Tax will occasionally encounter problems when:

Opening Lacerte,
Opening a client file,
Clicking on the Forms tab (calculating the return), or
Proforma'ing. 

When these issues occur Lacerte will present various errors to convey when a 'catastrophic error has occurred or when there was an 'exception init processing.' Under these situations the cause of the error can be attributed to a variety of things. Environmental factors such as third party products running in the background that is interfering with Lacerte's calculation engine, malware or viruses, including low system resources are often culprits working behind the scene affecting Lacerte's performance. As a general rule, the errors previously mentioned typically occur when the computer's system resources are insufficient to complete the task at hand. This is when you may want to consider using the Jx.confg-template file. This file was designed to enable Lacerte to allocate memory specifically for its calculation engine.

Solution:

To modify the 'template' file: 

Close Lacerte.
Browse to the local directory where the program is installed. 
  
In most cases it is C:\Lacerte\??tax (?? = tax year).  
 


   Locate the 
   JX.CONFIG-TEMPLATE file.
   
Right-click and rename it to JX.CONFIG.



  If you do not see the file extension, the ""display file extensions for known files types"" option may be turned off in Windows.  To enable display extensions for known file types.
    
 
Windows 7:


Navigate to C:\Lacerte\??tax (?? = tax year)
Click Organize on the Windows menu.
Click Folder and Search Options.
Click the View tab and uncheck the Hide extensions for known file types





Windows 8 & 10:


Navigate to C:\Lacerte\??tax (?? = tax year)
Click the View menu in the Window Explorer window.
Check the File name extensions box.
File extensions shold not be displayed.





Close Lacerte.
Double-click on the file and choose Select the program from a list option.


     Click 
     OK.
     
Select Notepad from the Programs list.
Uncheck the box, ""Always use the selected program to open this kind of file"".
Click OK.
Find the top line value that reads -Xmx384m.
Change the value 384 as needed.     
    
 Try a lower number like 128, and progressively move upward to 256 to as high as 640. 
      
You can increase or decrease the number as needed to find the 'sweet spot.' 
Keep in mind too little or too much memory can affect Lacerte's performance and cause an error. (The following image is an error that occurs when using a memory value that was too high.)    
 
 
Click on File.
Click on Save and close the Notepad file.  
Open the Lacerte program and test for functionality.  

Repeat Steps 1-14 until the right balance of memory is achieved. (You are no longer getting errors.)

Federal 1040 Schedule E: Real Estate Professional and Self-Employment Tax,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000029696_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+20%3A45%3A21+UTC,0,2017-08-10 20:45:21,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Problem Description
In preparing a return for a Real Estate Professional the box is checked for Real Estate Professional, consequently, the expectation is that the income will flow to a Schedule SE. The program, however, does not do this automatically. It is necessary to go to the Taxes section and then to the screen, Self-Employment Tax (Schedule SE), to adjust the Self-Employment Income, Why?

Solution Description
The program is following the guidance provided by the IRS. The first piece of guidance is found in the instructions for Line 43 on the Schedule E.





Reconciliation for real estate professionals.
If you were a real estate professional (see instructions), enter the net income or (loss) you reported anywhere on Form 1040 or Form 1040NR from all rental real estate activities in which you materially participated under the passive activity loss rules
.
 



The instructions define a passive on page E-2, Column 2,  activity as follows:




 A passive activity is any business activity in which you did not materially participate and any rental activity, except as explained later on this page. If you are a limited partner, you generally are not treated as having materially participated in the partnership's activities for the year. The rental of real or personal property is generally a rental activity under the passive activity loss rules, but exceptions apply. If your rental of property is not treated as a rental activity, you must determine whether it is a trade or business activity, and if so, whether you materially participated in the activity for the tax year. See the Instructions for Form 8582 to determine whether you materially participated in the activity and for the definition of ?rental activity.? 





  


 The instructions for 
 Schedule E page E-3
,  Column 1, state:


  







      Before you begin, see the instructions for lines 3 and 4 to determine if you should report your rental real estate and royalty income on Schedule C, Schedule C-EZ, or Form 4835 instead of Schedule E.
      





  


 Also, on page 3, Column 3, the instructions state:


  







      Rental income reported on Schedule E is not taxable for self-employment tax purposes. Electing qualified joint venture status and using the Schedule C or C-EZ does not alter the application of the self-employment tax or the passive loss limitation rules.

 Basis Limitation frequently asked questions.


Solution Description

What is basis limitation?


The basis limitation is a limitation on the losses and deductions that a partner in a Partnership or a shareholder in an S Corporation can deduct.
The basis limits are the first of three limitations that are applied to Schedule K-1 losses and deductions.
After the basis limits are applied, the At-Risk limits (Form 6198) are applied. If losses are allowed by the basis and at-risk limits, then the passive limits (Form 8582) are applied, if applicable.
The basis and at-risk limits are similar, in that the limits are applied separately to each K-1 input screen. Losses may be fully allowed on one activity, while another activity may have all of it's losses limited. The passive limits are applied by aggregating all passive activities together.




Is the requirement to attach a statement for S Corporation loss activities new this year?

No. The Schedule E instructions have had that requirement at least as far back as 1992.



Is there a form/instructions for the basis limitations?

There is no form. Please contact Internal Revenue Service for further information and instructions.



How is the Basis Limitation computed?

The starting point for the basis limitation is adjusted basis at the beginning of year. The following adjustments are made to arrive at the adjusted basis used in applying the basis limitation:
Increases:

Adjusted basis is increased by current income from the activity, additional amounts invested in the activity, and depletion in excess of the oil and gas property basis.
Additionally, for partners, the adjusted basis is increased by their share of the partnership's loans. This is not the case for shareholders. Because the S Corporation is a corporation, it is a distinct legal entity separate from the shareholder, so the shareholder does not increase his or her basis by their share of liabilities. The shareholder only increases basis by the loans they make directly to the corporation. This is why there is separate input for loan information in the S Corporation screen, but not the partnership screen. The partner's share of liabilities should be input into the ""Adjusted basis at beginning of year"" field.

Decreases:

Distributions, decreases in partner's share of partnership debt, or repayments received by shareholders.
If the current year disallowed loss, plus prior year disallowed losses, exceeds the basis computed, some of the loss is disallowed. Any disallowed loss is carried to the following year return and is treated as incurred in the following tax year.
For partners, the allowed loss is allocated pro-rata to each loss or deduction (Ordinary, 1231, capital gains/losses, 179 expense, etc). For shareholders, there are ordering rules. Nondeductible expenses and depletion are allowed in full first, unless the shareholder has filed an election to do otherwise. This election can be triggered in  the second Elections screen under the Other section, by entering the S Corporation name or number in S-Corporation name or number. Additionally, an entry of ""1"" needs to be made in ""1 = Deduct losses before nondeductible expenses and depletion, 2 = prorata"" (Income > S-Corp Info (1120S K-1) > Basis Limitation).




Is basis the same as partner capital shown on Schedule K-1?

No. According to the Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1, the basis schedule represents outside basis while the capital account represents inside basis. These can differ, even when the partnership maintains its books and records on a tax basis.  One way this difference can occur is when a partner buys his partnership interest from another partner, since the purchase price becomes the starting point for his outside basis.



Can basis ever become negative?

No. Per Internal Revenue code section 704(a)(2) and 1367(a)(2) basis can never fall below zero.  Negative basis should not be input in Adjusted basis at beginning of year.



What happens when distributions exceed an S Corporation shareholder's stock basis?

Per Internal Revenue code section 1368, the treatment of a distribution in excess of stock basis depends upon whether or not the S-Corporation has any earnings or profits from when it was a C Corporation.
If there was no earnings and profits, then any amount distributed in excess of stock basis is considered gain from the sale or exchange of property (IRC. 1368(b)(2)).
If the S-Corporation had earnings and profits from when it was a Corporation, then, per Internal Revenue Code section 1368(c) the following rules apply:
A. The portion of the distribution that does not exceed the accumulated adjustments account is treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of property.B. The portion of the distribution remaining after step A (above) is treated as a dividend to the extent it does not exceed accumulated earnings and profits of the S-Corporation.C. Any distribution remaining after applying the two steps above is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.
To enter any gain determined by the above rules, enter a disposition in Income > Schedule D/4797/etc. Additionally, enter the amount of the gain in Other current year increases to basis (Income > S-Corp Info (1120S K-1) > Basis Limitation).



What happens when distributions exceed partner basis?

Distributions in excess of basis results in gain (IRC. 731(a)(1)).  Any gain recognized is considered gain from the sale of exchange of the partnership interest. See Internal revenue code section 731 for how to determine the character of the gain.



How is income used to restore Shareholder debt basis computed?

The program computes this amount in accordance with Internal Revenue code section 1367(b)(2)(B) which states that any net increase to basis increases debt basis before stock basis. This ""Net increase"" is the amount by which current year income and other increases to basis exceed current and prior year losses, and other decreases to basis.



The loss from Schedule K-1 has enough basis to be allowed. Why isn't it showing on Schedule E page 2?

Most likely, the loss is being limited by either the at-risk or passive limits. To see if the loss is disallowed by at-risk, please view Form 6198. To see if the loss is disallowed by passive, view Form 8582, or if it is a publicly traded partnership, view the Passive worksheets.




My basis is zero. Why are losses being allowed?

Most likely, the loss being allowed is an at-risk or a passive carryover from a prior year. At-risk and passive carryovers are not limited by basis, since those losses have been allowed by the basis limits in a prior year. The limits are applied in order (basis, at-risk, then passive), once a loss has been allowed by a limitation, that limitation never gets reapplied.



Why aren't the AMT adjustments I entered in the K-1 input screen appearing on Form 6251, lines 16 or 17?

When the basis limitations are applied to a K-1 input screen activity, the AMT adjustments are used in computing an Alternative Minimum Tax version of the basis limitations. The AMT adjusted gain or depreciation adjustment will either be reported on line 19 as a loss adjustment, or if the passive limits are being applied, on line 18 as a passive adjustment. If all loss is disallowed, the current year AMT adjustments will be reflected in a different AMT loss carryover (eg. AMT basis carryover may be higher than regular basis carryover).

Transfer / Bridge Clients Between Corporation and S Corporation Programs Modules,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000039298_en_US?modified_at=2017-08-10+20%3A45%3A58+UTC,1,2017-08-10 20:45:58,Last Modified 253 days ago,"How can I transfer or bridge clients between the Corporate and S Corporate modules?
  

Solution:
Client files can be transferred the Corporate (Form 1120) and S Corporate (Form 1120S) tax modules by using the Import clients from Corporate/S Corporation utility without having to reenter the client detail. This process is an efficient way to convert your clients between these two tax types.  

To Import clients between the Corporate and S Corporate modules:


  


Note:  You may need to remove any passwords from the client file prior to bridging to avoid any issues.


Go to the Tax Module you want to transfer the existing client file to.  *Note: This is this not the current location of the client file but the desired location. Example: To import a tax client from Corporation to S Corporation, access the S Corporation module.  
Click on Tools.
Select Import clients from Corporate or, Import clients from S-Corporation.    
Select the client to import and click OK.    
Enter a number for the imported client and click OK.    Caution: If you select a client number for the new client that already exist on the current data path, the program prompts you that a client with the same number already exist in the data path. If you import the client to an existing client number, the program overwrites the existing client.  
The imported client will convert and should now appear in the client list.


  


The following limitations apply when importing clients between the Corporation and S-Corporation Tax programs:


 The program imports only federal codes. State-specific data must be reentered. 
 When exporting a Corporation client to a S-Corporation client, only corporate officers with common stock percentages become shareholders in the new S-Corporation. Additional shareholders must be added in the S-Corporation Shareholder Information, Screen 5.

Information on Affordable Care Act and Frequently Asked Questions.

Detailed Information
The Individual Shared Responsibility Provision requires an Individual and each member of their family to have qualifying health insurance (called minimum essential coverage), have an exemption, or make a shared responsibility payment when you file your federal income tax return. 
 


What is Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)?    This level of insurance coverage considered to meet the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Plans and coverage that contains MEC are also referred to as qualified plans.  MEC includes:   
  
Government-sponsored programs 
    
Medicare part A, most Medicaid programs, CHIP, most TRICARE, most VA programs, Peace Corps, DOD Non-appropriated Fund employees
 
Employer-sponsored coverage 
    
Insured or self-insured group health plans
Does not include coverage that is solely excepted benefits
 
Individual market coverage 
    
Qualified health plans enrolled in through Marketplace
Other individual coverage
 
Grandfathered plans
Miscellaneous MEC 
    
Other health benefits coverage recognized by HHS as MEC for this purpose  For a link to an article which summarizes plans and coverages which do and do NOT meet MEC, click here.  
 
 

What are Forms 1095-A, 1095-B, and 1095-C?  Form 1095-A- Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, is used to report certain information to the IRS about family members who enroll in a qualified health plan through the Marketplace.  The ""Marketplace"" refers to the Federal Healthcare.gov site as well as state-run healthcare exchanges.  Form 1095-B- Health Coverage, is used to report certain information to the IRS and to taxpayers about individuals who are covered by MEC and therefore are not liable for the ISRP (Individual Shared Responsibility Payment). A 1095-B must be filed by every person that provide MEC to an individual during a calendar year must file an information return (1095-B) and transmittal (1094-B). 1095-B's can be issued to individuals and families that purchased a qualified plan outside of the Marketplace such as directly from an insurance agency.   Form 1095-C- Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage, employers with 50 or more full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) use Form 1094-C (transmittal) and Form 1095-C (return).  These forms are then furnished to their employees and are used to complete their Individual tax returns. Form 1095-A is also furnished to individuals to allow them to claim the premium tax credit. Please see the form instructions for more information.   

If the Taxpayer did not have MEC or an exemption is there a penalty?  Yes. Individuals who do not have minimum essential coverage and do not qualify for an exemption may be liable for the individual shared responsibility payment (ISRP). See Affordable Care Act Penalty for more information.    

Who is eligible for the Premium Tax Credit?  Starting in 2014, if you get your health insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you may be eligible for the premium tax credit. See The Premium Tax Credit for more information.   

What line of Form 1040 will the ISRP go on?  The Individual responsibility will flow to Form 1040, line 61. Either the box will be checked ""Full-year coverage"" or an amount will display on the line if a payment is due.   

How do I enter the ACA information in the ProConnect Tax Online (PTO) program?  The screens for the ACA inputs are under the Credits section in the Input Return workspace.

The default location for a program installation will be on the C drive under the Lacerte tax folder. When the Local install option is selected, the program and client database will reside under the same folder location.  This is the same default option as in previous years. 

Network Install - For the Network installation, The Selected Installation Folder location determines where the tax program will be installed.  The Selected Network Folder determines where the system file path will be installed.

Individual Form 8962 and SE Health Insurance Deduction,https://accountants-community.intuit.com/content/p_sb_qbo_gl_sf_na_article:000031326_en_US?modified_at=2018-04-20+02%3A14%3A19+UTC,0,2018-04-21 22:44:08,Last Modified 253 days ago,"Description
How does the program calculate the Form 8962 with the SE health insurance deduction?

Solution Description
If Form 8962 is generating with a Premium Tax Credit and you have a SE health insurance deduction on 1040 line 29, your deduction and credit may be adjusted by the calculations described in Rev. Proc. 2014-41.
Important! If the amount of SE Health Insurance deduction entered in the screen, Adjustments to Income, is the same amount entered in the screen, Form 1095-A - Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, you will need to remove the amount from the Adjustments to Income screen before completing the steps below. Only enter in the Adjustments to Income screen those premiums not entered elsewhere.
To have the program calculate the SE Health Insurance Premium in conjunction with the PTC:

Go to the screen, Form 1095-A - Health Insurance Marketplace Statement.
Scroll down to the SE Health Insurance Deduction section.
Select the applicable form in the field, Form (Click on arrow to select from list) from the drop down menu.
Select the applicable Activity name or number from the drop down menu.
Enter the Related activity start month (if applicable).
Enter the Related activity end month (if applicable).

 

 

FAQs-How is the program coming up with the amounts for the SE Health Insurance Deduction and PTC?

The basic rules are to reduce the SE Health Insurance Deduction by the PTC amount so the return is not doubling the deduction and to reduce the premiums paid by any advanced payments. You may use any calculation method you want that satisfies the requirements of the tax law. 
Per Rev. Proc. 2014-41 Section 3. Scope,
""Using the calculations in this revenue procedure is optional.""
 
Why are the amounts different on the return after a recent update? 

The program has a Self-employed Health and Premium Tax Credit Reconciliation worksheet that shows the calculation on the 1040, line 29. This calculation shows how the program is coming up with the Health Insurance Premiums on line 1 of the worksheet.

Note:  This form only applies to qualified electric vehicle passive activity credits from prior years (allowed on form 8582-CR or form 8810 for the current year).  This credit would be allowed on Form 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations (for individuals, trusts, and estates), or Form 8810, Corporate Passive Activity Loss and Credit Limitations (for corporations), for the current tax year.


  


Form 8936 Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit - Use Form 8936 to figure your credit for qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles you placed in service during your tax year. Also use Form 8936 to figure your credit for certain qualified two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles acquired after 2014.  The qualified plug-in electric vehicle credit attributable to depreciable property (vehicles used for business or investment purposes) is treated as a general business credit. Any credit not attributable to depreciable property is treated as a personal credit allowed against both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax.  Partnerships and S corporations must file this form to claim the credit. All other taxpayers are not required to complete or file this form if their only source for this credit is a partnership or S corporation. Instead, they can report this credit directly on line 1y in Part III of Form 3800, General Business Credit.
